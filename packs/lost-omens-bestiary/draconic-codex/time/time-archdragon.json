None would say time is a firm onward march of linear progress, moving inexorably to a predetermined result. Time is fluid and ever-shifting, and time dragons dedicate themselves to protecting its flow.</p>\n<p>Although safeguarding the natural temporal order is a mission all time dragons devote themselves to, they go about it in different ways. Staunch traditionalists oppose any meddling with the timestream whatsoever, even to repair damage caused by prior attempts to influence it, viewing this as doing more harm than good. They believe mortals are too short-sighted to responsibly use time magic and might appear without warning to slay those they believe pose a threat to the timestream. Other time dragons attempt to guide the course of events along the path they believe correct while preventing external tampering, often focusing on particular regions, areas of interest, or even individuals</p>",

            "publicNotes": "<p>Legends state the first executor dragons formed from the rage-filled screams of Sarenrae during her struggle against the Rough Beast. In the face of an enemy even she had no hope of redeeming, the ever-compassionate Dawnflower allowed her divine fury to escape from her lips as she struck down the primordial god, and from this act of anathema, the first executor dragons were given form. Since that moment, executor dragons represent the full wrath of the gods. Divine in nature, executor dragons typically appear to punish those who have strayed so far from the path of their deity's edicts as to begin embracing the anathema. Due to their potent nature as weapons of the divine, executor dragons are generally drawn to target not a single misbehaving follower, but entire villages, cities, or towns that have turned their backs on their gods. Many of the gods prefer not to use executor dragons as part of their punishment of mortal transgressors, and instead keep them reserved for the days of apocalyptic battles.</p>\n<p>Though many believe executor dragons are spawned from divine magic, they are fully biological creatures. Compelled by faith and devotion and disgusted by hypocrisy and base cruelty, executor dragons tend to live near human settlements, but rarely within them. They form small familial groups when young, but grow more independent as they age, seeking to claim territory uninhabited by other dragons. Their chosen lairs tend to be locations secreted away, either in the ruins of mountaintop monasteries or in the cavernous depths beneath abandoned places of worship. For the few executor dragons that live actively among non-draconic peoples, even fewer do so in their natural forms. They are sometimes found living disguised as traveling lay priests who bring healing and alms for the needy, choristers singing hymnals, wandering monastic scholars who ask challenging and conflicted questions about faith, or quiet church custodians who protect and beautify their chosen houses of worship. It's said that one or more executor dragons might have even taken up the defense of Kenebres after its near destruction at the hands of the Khorramzadeh, Storm King of the Worldwound.</p>",

Adding further to the gokeki's bizarre appearance are the creature's extra pair of eyes and the nearly vestigial pincers sprouting from its chest. Gokeki fur is generally light tan in color, darkening noticeably toward the creature's tail, although subspecies with bright green, yellow, or even fluorescent pink or purple fur have also been reported.</p>\n<p>Unlike many of Castrovel's native creatures, gokekis aren't generally regarded to be a product of natural evolution, but rather the result of a genetic experiment that broke loose from its creator and escaped into the wild. Gokekis have adapted frighteningly well to the planet's harsh jungle environment, although thankfully they seem to lack both the intelligence and sociability often exhibited by primates. Gokekis hunt alone or, more rarely, in mated pairs. Attempts to domesticate gokekis often result in the death of their would-be owners, although when provided with a proper range in which to hunt, gokekis can serve as guardians for those looking to deter unwanted visitors.</p>\n<p>Though dangerous predators, gokekis are highly sought after by Castrovel's hunting cultures, particularly the lizardfolk and tripkees who call the jungle continent of Ukulam their home. The former value gokekis for their webbing harpoons, which function as ready-made javelins. Meanwhile, tripkees harvest the gokeki's filament gland to aid in the construction of the treetop homes. Both peoples also eat gokeki meat, which when properly prepared can be made into a flavorful and hearty jerky.</p><h2>Harvested Treasures</h2><p>While gokekis aren't intelligent enough to gather treasure of their own, many natives of Castrovel consider their bodies a valuable resource. If harvested with a successful @Check[nature|dc:17] or @Check[survival|dc:17] check, the gokeki's filament gland can be used as 25 gp worth of raw materials for potent glues such as @UUID[Compendium.pf2e.equipment-srd.Item.Everlasting Adhesive]. The filament itself is identical to a 60-foot length of rope. Finally, the creature's harpoon can be used as a javelin.</p>",

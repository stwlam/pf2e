Though it always feels dry to the touch, this banner from a distance gleams red as if slightly stained with the blood of your enemies. While holding a banner of piercing shards, you can use the following ability.</p>\n<p><strong>Activate—Shards Seek Wounds</strong> <span class=\"action-glyph\">1</span> (concentrate)</p>\n<p><strong>Frequency</strong> once per minute</p><hr /><p><strong>Effect</strong> Shards of sharpened glass violently shoot out from the magical banner into the newly opened wounds of a nearby enemy.

Once they arrive, however, their combined might is undeniable. The first time each day you spend 10 minutes resting, you gain 1 Mythic Point. During this time, you don't need to sleep, but you can't perform activities like Refocus or @UUID[Compendium.pf2e.actionspf2e.Item.Treat Wounds]. You gain the @UUID[Compendium.pf2e.actionspf2e.Item.Summon Sloth] activity.</p>"

You drop prone and make a fist Strike against the prone enemy. You don't take the penalty from being prone to this Strike's attack roll, nor do you need to have a free hand to make it. If you're wielding a @UUID[Compendium.pf2e.equipment-srd.Item.Gauntlet] or @UUID[Compendium.pf2e.equipment-srd.Item.Spiked Gauntlet], you can Strike with one of those weapons instead of your fist. If you hit, you @UUID[Compendium.pf2e.conditionitems.Item.Immobilized]{immobilize} the target, and you can add your armor's item bonus to your Athletics for the @UUID[Compendium.pf2e.actionspf2e.Item.Escape] DC. The immobilization ends automatically if you Stand or otherwise move from the spot where you dropped prone.</p>"

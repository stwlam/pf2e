Through a combination of hearing these tales and channeling a hint of those warriors' mythic power, you've developed a knack for bypassing a mythic creature's fabled defenses. The next time you successfully Strike the triggering creature, your Strike treats its mythic resistance as 2 lower. You treat its resistance as 4 lower if your Hero-God Lore or Legendary Beast Lore proficiency rank is expert, 6 lower if your rank is master, and 8 lower if your rank is legendary.</p>\n<p>If your Strike would already ignore mythic resistance (because you are a mythic character or wield a mythic weapon), your next successful Strike against the creature instead deals an additional 1d6 precision damage. This additional damage increases to 1d8 if your Hero-God Lore or Legendary Beast Lore proficiency rank is expert, 1d10 if your rank is master, or 1d12 if your rank is legendary.</p>"

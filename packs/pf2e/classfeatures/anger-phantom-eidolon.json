            "value": "<p>Your eidolon is a lost soul, bound to the mortal world by undying anger or a bitter grudge. Most phantom eidolons are humanoids with a spectral or ectoplasmic appearance, though some take far stranger forms. Your link with your eidolon prevents it from succumbing to corruption and undeath. Together, you will need to decide whether to work with your eidolon to control its anger, or channel its wrath into power.</p>\n<p><strong>Tradition</strong> occult</p>\n<p><strong>Traits</strong> eidolon, ethereal, phantom</p>\n<p><strong>Home Plane</strong> Ethereal Plane</p><hr /><p><strong>Size</strong> Medium or Small</p>\n<p><strong>Suggested Attacks</strong> fist (bludgeoning), tendril (bludgeoning), unarmed attacks shaped like a weapon</p>\n<p><strong>Wrathful Berserker</strong> Str 18, Dex 14, Con 16, Int 8, Wis 10, Cha 12; +2 AC (+3 Dex cap)</p>\n<p><strong>Enraged Assassin</strong> Str 14, Dex 18, Con 16, Int 10, Wis 8, Cha 12; +1 AC (+4 Dex cap)</p>\n<p><strong>Skills</strong> Intimidation, Occultism</p>\n<p><strong>Senses</strong> darkvision</p>\n<p><strong>Language</strong> one common mortal language the eidolon spoke in life</p>\n<p><strong>Speed</strong> 25 feet</p><hr /><p><strong>Eidolon Abilities</strong> <em>Initial</em> furious strike; <em>Symbiosis</em> seething frenzy; <em>Transcendence</em> anger aura</p><h2>Furious Strike</h2><p>Your eidolon can infuse an attack with unmitigated rage. It gains the @UUID[Compendium.pf2e.actionspf2e.Item.Furious Strike] activity.</p><h2>Seething Frenzy<span style=\"float:right\">7th</span></h2><p>Your eidolon can stoke itself into a frenzy. It gains the @UUID[Compendium.pf2e.actionspf2e.Item.Seething Frenzy] action.</p><h2>Anger Aura<span style=\"float:right\">17th</span></h2><p>Your eidolon exudes wrath in an aura around it, rousing the ire of nearby creatures and causing their defenses to crack as they seethe with rage. Your eidolon gains a 20-foot anger aura, which has the aura, emotion, enchantment, mental, and occult traits. The resistances of any creature in the aura, including you, your allies, your enemies, and your eidolon, are reduced by an amount equal to 3 + your eidolon's Constitution modifier. Your eidolon can hold in its rage by spending a single action, which has the concentrate trait. This reduces the aura's effect to affect only your eidolon. It can take this action again to reinstate the full effect of its aura. Creatures in a barbarian Rage, Seething Frenzy, or similar ability that allows them to channel their anger aren't affected by the anger aura.</p>"

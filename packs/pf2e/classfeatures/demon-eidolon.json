            "value": "<p>Your eidolon is a demon, born of mortal sin congealed amid the chaos and evil of the Abyss, using its link to you to spread chaos at your side. Choose an associated sin for your demon. Demon eidolons have appearances as varied as the infinite Abyss. While demons are inherently untrustworthy, your demon eidolon has reached an accord with you and generally keeps it, though that doesn't mean your eidolon isn't actively working to bring your life deeper into its associated sin. Though a true demon, your demon eidolon's link to you as a mortal prevents them from casting the abyssal pact ritual, even if they somehow learn it.</p>\n<p><strong>Tradition</strong> divine</p>\n<p><strong>Traits</strong> demon, eidolon, fiend</p>\n<p><strong>Alignment</strong> must be chaotic evil</p>\n<p><strong>Home Plane</strong> The Abyss</p><hr /><p><strong>Size</strong> Medium or Small</p>\n<p><strong>Suggested Attacks</strong> claw (slashing), jaws (piercing), horn (piercing), tail (bludgeoning), tentacle (bludgeoning), wing (bludgeoning)</p>\n<p><strong>Wrecker Demon</strong> Str 18, Dex 14, Con 16, Int 10, Wis 8, Cha 12; +2 AC (+3 Dex cap)</p>\n<p><strong>Tempter Demon</strong> Str 12, Dex 18, Con 12, Int 10, Wis 10, Cha 16; +1 AC (+4 Dex cap)</p>\n<p><strong>Skills</strong> Intimidation, Religion</p>\n<p><strong>Senses</strong> darkvision</p>\n<p><strong>Language</strong> Abyssal</p>\n<p><strong>Speed</strong> 25 feet</p><hr /><p><strong>Eidolon Abilities</strong> <em>Initial</em> demonic strikes; <em>Symbiosis</em> visions of sin; <em>Transcendence</em> blasphemous decree</p><h2>Demonic Strikes</h2><p>Your eidolon's attacks are corrupted by the Abyss and imbued with pure evil and shifting chaos. All your eidolon's unarmed Strikes deal an extra 1 evil damage; as usual, this extra damage harms only good creatures or those with a weakness to evil damage. Additionally, choose one of your eidolon's unarmed attacks that deals physical damage; it gains the versatile trait for a different type of physical damage you choose.</p><h2>Visions of Sin<span style=\"float:right\">7th</span></h2><p>Your demon is born of sin and can project the sin it is formed from into the minds of others.

It can cast an evil @UUID[Compendium.pf2e.spells-srd.Item.Divine Decree] once per day as a 9th-level spell. You are unaffected by this decree, even if you aren't evil. At 19th level, this becomes a 10th-level divine decree instead.</p>"

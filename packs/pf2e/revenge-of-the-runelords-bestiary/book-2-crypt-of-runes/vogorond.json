Because their consciousnesses are formed from millions or even billions of individuals, however, they rarely possess the reasoning needed to pursue their desires to an end.</p><h2>Reasoning With the Ruined Past</h2><p>While a vogorond's memories aren't flawless, it knows more about its former world than any scholar could ever hope to learn. Often, a vogorond is the only remaining source of knowledge about the land it once inhabited. Theoretically, heroes from a world on the brink of destruction could travel forward in time to speak with a vogorond and learn what must be done to avert the apocalypse—an act which, paradoxically, would prevent the vogorond from being created in the first place.</p>",

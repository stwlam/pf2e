A Spawn of Rovagug's regeneration is powerful enough to revive it even if slain by a death effect. If the Spawn fails a save against an effect that would kill it instantly, it rises from death 3 rounds later with 1 Hit Point. A Spawn can still be banished, imprisoned, or transported away as a means to save a region or kept in a state of dying by an effect that deals constant damage.</p>"

On a success, the creature is @UUID[Compendium.pf2e.conditionitems.Item.Grabbed] (Escape DC equal to the DC of the dragon's Hydraulic Breath). On a critical success, or a success against a creature already grabbed, the target is dragged below the surface and begins to drown. All tentacles disappear at the end of the dragon's next turn unless the effect is Sustained and a new Athletics check is rolled for all existing tentacles.</p>"

Any foe targeting the phase dragon with an attack must first succeed at a @Check[flat|dc:15]. On a failure, the phase dragon isn't affected and one of the illusory duplicates is shattered; the DC of the next flat check for Afterimage Jumps is reduced by 5. Any remaining images disappear at the start of the dragon's next turn.</p>\n<p>@Check[flat|dc:10] @Check[flat|dc:5]</p>"

The rift measures 5 feet wide, 10 feet high, and up to 20 feet long, and can be Sustained for up to 1 minute. While the rift is open, any creature occupying its area or an adjacent square at the start of its turn takes @Damage[3d6[fire]|options:area-damage] damage (+1 die for each dragon age category beyond young) and an equal amount of spirit damage with a @Check[reflex|basic|dc:] save. The dragon can choose instead to open a rift to Cocytus, the frozen seventh layer of Hell, to replace this fire damage with cold damage, although it is still subject to the dragon's Diabolic Fire ability.</p>"

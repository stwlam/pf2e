Light does not enter the area and any non-magical light sources, such as a torch or lantern, do not emanate any light while inside the area, even if their light radius would extend beyond the darkness. This also suppresses magical light of a spell rank equal to half the dragon's level or lower. Light can't pass through, so all creatures in the area except for the dragon can't see outside.</p>"

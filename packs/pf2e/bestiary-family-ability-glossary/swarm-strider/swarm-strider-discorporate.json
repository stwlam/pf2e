If even one of the creatures gets away, the swarm strider can eventually re-form over 1d10 days (potentially longer in areas where there are few invertebrates).</p>\n<p>The scattered invertebrates must be destroyed within 1 round to destroy the swarm strider permanently. The invertebrates have a collective pool of HP, typically equal to 1/4 of the swarm strider's maximum HP, and the same AC, saves, immunities, resistances, and weaknesses as the swarm strider. The invertebrates can't take actions but they escape automatically once the round elapses. At the GM's discretion, clever means of trapping or eliminating the creatures might be sufficient to destroy the swarm strider.</p>"

However, many holy armies know that an extra hand never hurts in the fight to exterminate cruelty and unholy forces, and they might call upon the assistance of a holy army. The holy army occupies the space of a Huge creature. When you Cast this Spell, choose one of the holy militaries below to summon.</p><ul><li><p><strong>Agathions</strong> Speed 30 feet</p><ul><li><strong>Arrive</strong> (fire) <em>Pranks for All</em> A squadron of procyals arrives, eager to see your enemies learn their lesson in this fight. All enemies in a @Template[cone|distance:60] take @Damage[8d6[fire]|options:area-damage|traits:fire] damage (@Check[reflex|basic|options:area-effect|traits:fire] save) as the procyals bombard them with popping firecrackers</li><li><strong>Depart</strong> <em>Parting Lesson</em> (emotion, mental) The procyals laugh uproariously as they leave, each throwing out a piece of unrelated advice to a nearby enemy. Enemies in a @Template[type:emanation|distance:20] take @Damage[4d6[mental]|options:area-damage|traits:emotion,mental] damage (@Check[will|basic|options:area-effect,inflicts:stunned|traits:emotion,mental] save). On a failure, a creature is also @UUID[Compendium.pf2e.conditionitems.Item.Stunned]{Stunned 1}. On a critical failure, they're @UUID[Compendium.pf2e.conditionitems.Item.Stunned]{Stunned 2}.</li></ul></li><li><p><strong>Angels</strong> Speed 30 feet, fly 40 feet</p><ul><li><strong>Arrive</strong> (spirit) <em>Flaming Truth</em> A legion of balisses arrive in a burst of holy flame, dealing @Damage[8d6[spirit]|options:area-damage] damage to all creatures in a @Template[type:emanation|distance:20] with a @Check[fortitude|basic|options:area-effect,inflicts:blinded|traits:spirit] save. On a critical failure, a creature is also @UUID[Compendium.pf2e.conditionitems.Item.Blinded] for 1 round</li><li><strong>Depart</strong> <em>Hidden Departure</em> With a plume of smoke, the balisses vanish, spreading a thick cloud of smoke in a @Template[type:emanation|distance:10]. All creatures within the smoke are @UUID[Compendium.pf2e.conditionitems.Item.Concealed]. Unholy creatures within the smoke are @UUID[Compendium.pf2e.conditionitems.Item.Enfeebled]{Enfeebled 2}, and holy creatures within the smoke gain the effects of truesight and ignore the concealment granted by the smoke.</li></ul></li><li><p><strong>Archons</strong> Speed 30 feet, fly 60 feet</p><ul><li><strong>Arrive</strong> (spirit) <em>Justice Prevails</em> A battalion of aesras, also known as legion archons, swoop in to provide assistance. Enemies within a @Template[type:cone|distance:60] take @Damage[8d6[spirit]|options:area-damage] damage (@Check[reflex|basic|options:area-effect|traits:spirit] save)</li><li><strong>Depart</strong> (fire) <em>Eyes of Judgment</em> With one final examination of the battlefield, the aesras take their leave, but not before bringing down their fiery swords to create a corridor of sacred flame. Enemies in a @Template[type:line|distance:60] take @Damage[4d6[slashing],2d6[persistent,fire]|options:area-damage] damage (@Check[reflex|basic|options:area-effect|traits:fire] save).</li></ul></li><li><p><strong>Azatas</strong> Speed 30 feet, fly 80 feet</p><ul><li><strong>Arrive</strong> (auditory, sonic) <em>Inspiring Song</em> Kanya muses arrive to embolden your allies while pushing back your foes. Enemies in a @Template[type:emanation|distance:20] take @Damage[6d6[sonic]|options:area-damage|traits:auditory,sonic] damage (@Check[fortitude|basic|options:area-effect,forced-movement|traits:auditory,sonic] save). A creature that fails the save is also pushed 10 feet away from the kanyas. Allies in the emanation gain a +2 status bonus to attack rolls and saving throws, as well as +4 status bonus to damage rolls for the duration of the spell</li><li><strong>Depart</strong> (emotion, fear, mental) <em>Booming Finale</em> With a thunderous chord that stirs the hearts of your forces, the kanyas depart. Enemies in a @Template[type:cone|distance:60] must attempt a @Check[will|options:area-effect,inflicts:deafened,inflicts:frightened|traits:emotion,fear,mental] save. On a failure, they're @UUID[Compendium.pf2e.conditionitems.Item.Frightened]{Frightened 2}, and on a critical failure, they're @UUID[Compendium.pf2e.conditionitems.Item.Frightened]{Frightened 3} and @UUID[Compendium.pf2e.conditionitems.Item.Deafened] for 1 round. Allies in this cone regain @Damage[(4d10+16)[healing]|traits:emotion,fear,mental] Hit Points.</li></ul></li><li><p><strong>Garudas</strong> Speed 25 feet, fly 60 feet</p><ul><li><strong>Arrive</strong> <em>Swooping Dive</em> A battalion of garudas sweep through enemy lines, dealing @Damage[6d10[slashing]|options:area-damage] damage to enemies in a @Template[line|distance:120] (@Check[reflex|basic|options:area-effect] save)</li><li><strong>Depart</strong> <em>Winds of Freedom</em> The garudas flap their wings in tandem, focusing on a @Template[burst|distance:20] within 60 feet of them.

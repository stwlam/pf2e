At 15th level, you need only be on the same plane as your warshard weapon to call it, and at 18th level, you can call your warshard weapon across any distance. If your warshard weapon is in the possession of a mythic creature that's higher level than you or placed in an area where teleportation magic doesn't function, attempt a @Check[flat|dc:16]. On a success, your warshard weapon still teleports to your hand.</p>"

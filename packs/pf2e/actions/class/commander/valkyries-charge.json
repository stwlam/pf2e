If an affected ally was @UUID[Compendium.pf2e.conditionitems.Item.Unconscious] due to their Hit Points being reduced to 0, they can immediately Stand and pick up any dropped weapons as a free action. Then, each affected squadmate can, as a free action, Stride up to twice their Speed directly toward an enemy they are observing; if they end this movement with an enemy within their reach, they can attempt to Strike that enemy as a reaction.</p>\n<p>Squadmates can use Valkyrie's Charge while Burrowing, Climbing, Flying, or Swimming instead of Striding if they have the corresponding movement type.</p>"

Signal all squadmates within the aura of your banner; you and each ally can Step as a free action directly toward a hostile creature. Any hostile creatures within 10 feet of a squadmate after this movement must attempt a @Check[will|against:commander|options:area-effect,inflicts:fleeing,inflicts:frightened|traits:emotion,fear,mental] save against your class DC; on a failure they become @UUID[Compendium.pf2e.conditionitems.Item.Fleeing] for 1 round, and on a critical failure they become fleeing for 1 round and @UUID[Compendium.pf2e.conditionitems.Item.Frightened]{Frightened 2}. This is an emotion, fear, and mental effect.</p>"

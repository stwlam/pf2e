Choose an enemy within 30 feet to be your taunted enemy. If your taunted enemy takes a hostile action that includes at least one of your allies but doesn't include you, they take a –1 circumstance penalty to their attack rolls and DCs for that action, and they also become @UUID[Compendium.pf2e.conditionitems.Item.Off-Guard] until the start of their next turn.</p>\n<p>Your enemy remains taunted until the start of your next turn, and you can have only one Taunt in effect at a time. Taunting a new enemy ends this effect on any current target.</p>\n<p>@UUID[Compendium.pf2e.feat-effects.Item.Effect: Taunt]</p>"

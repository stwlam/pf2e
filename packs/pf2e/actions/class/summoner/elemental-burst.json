Your eidolon loses a number of Hit Points equal to your level. All creatures in a @Template[type:burst|distance:20] within 60 feet take @Damage[(max(6,(@actor.level - 1)))d6|options:area-damage] damage with a @Check[reflex|basic|options:area-effect] save against your spell DC. The damage increases by 1d6 for each level you have beyond 7th. The damage's type is either fire damage if your eidolon is a fire elemental, or the same physical damage type as your eidolon's primary unarmed attack if your eidolon isn't a fire elemental. Elemental Burst gains any traits that your eidolon's unarmed attacks gain from elemental core.</p>"

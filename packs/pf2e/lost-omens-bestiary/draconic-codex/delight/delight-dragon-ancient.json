At least, as correct as if they said a puff of chimney smoke resembled a massive storm cloud or compared a toddler's drawing of a horse to a prized thoroughbred. Which is to say, they are completely and utterly incorrect. Of course, having a smoke cloud or child's drawing running around one's home might be vastly preferable to a delight dragon.</p>\n<p>As residents of the Outer Plane Elysium, delight dragons are embodiments of the plane's proclivity toward joy, mischief, passion, and spontaneity. Their massive gossamer wings refract the light of a thousand rainbows between translucent layers. Purple-green scales shimmer in opalescent splendor, while a long, sinuous tail flicks in spiral figures, darting to catch the feet out from under distracted observers. A pair of feathery antennae direct the delight dragon to their next source of amusement—whether play, treat, or general amusement, all surely to become a great time in the dragon's presence, whether a plane's denizens know it or not.</p>\n<p>As self-proclaimed defenders of games, whimsy, and the freedom to sow a little chaos, delight dragons are often found on the front line against those that would strip such choice away from others. Demonic forces deployed at the Worldwound whispered of the \"lights of doom,\" massive rainbows that heralded the approach of a delight dragon. The winged crusader would descend upon these fiends with claws and fangs, cackling all the while.</p>",

It doesn't have any specific memories from the target, but it can use information about the creature gained from any of the casters to Impersonate the target. It looks exactly like the target and has a Deception modifier to Impersonate that creature equal to the modifier of the secondary spellcaster who rolled the Deception check, with a +4 status bonus. Though it doesn't have any of the original's special abilities, like a dragon's breath, illusions allow it to appear to use those abilities; they just never seem to have an effect. For instance, against a double's dragon's breath, all creatures in the area seem to critically succeed at their saving throws and take no damage. Creatures can attempt to disbelieve the illusion by attempting a Perception check against the Deception DC of the secondary spellcaster who rolled the Deception check.</p><hr /><p><strong>Critical Success</strong> You create the shadow double.

Natives of the Netherworld, these occult dragons are at home in the darkness, using it to their advantage both in and out of battle. Umbral dragons rarely worry about fighting fairly, emerging from hiding to strike unwary foes and using their magical breath without compunction. Similarly, in social situations, they often remain in the shadows, operating through other creatures. Even in direct conversation, they frequently obscure their true intent, preferring to avoid ever being pinned down with a solid answer.</p>\n<p>While umbral dragons are rarely altruistic, their preferred diet creates a strange dichotomy that attracts other creatures to them as a potential source of safety, especially in the Netherworld. While much of the multiverse sees undead as a dire threat, for umbral dragons, undead are a tasty snack. Umbral dragons find the flavor of necrotic flesh irresistible and the void energy of incorporeal undead a potent spice, making them one of the few creatures in existence known to hunt the unliving as a source of food.</p>",

They have a mastery of vital energies, allowing them to restore life to the dead, and a mastery of void energies, to bestow death on others. They make use of their abilities to play with the lives of mortals, calling on spirits to aid them or reviving creatures they find important or interesting. The lair of a resurrection dragon is generally a barren place. While they still hoard wealth like other dragons, they do little to decorate their lairs and treasures are generally kept in dark niches, as if the dragon has little care for their possessions. Resurrection dragons tend to take tokens from those they resurrect or plan to resurrect, however, and these are kept particularly safe.</p>",

                    "value": "<p>You perform a ritual to imprison a creature in one of several forms. While some versions of this ritual offer all the forms, others include only a single form or only a few of them. Whichever form you use, the effect can't be counteracted, though it can be ended by @UUID[Compendium.pf2e.spells-srd.Item.Freedom]. Some forms of <em>imprisonment</em> can be ended by other means. Because the ritual requires the target to remain within 10 feet at all times, it typically requires you to subdue the target first.</p><ul><li><strong>Chains</strong> You bind the creature with chains, rendering it unable to use any actions other than to speak. Other creatures that attempt to approach, harm the chains, or free the trapped creature in any way must succeed at a Will save or be unable to do so forever. The chains have Hardness equal to 5 × the <em>imprisonment</em> ritual's spell rank and double that many Hit Points. Destroying the chains frees the target.</li><li><strong>Prison</strong> You render the creature completely unable to leave a particular confined area or structure of your choice, such as a jail cell or sealed cave. The magic also prevents the creature from damaging its prison, either directly or indirectly, to break free. If the creature's prison is entirely destroyed by some external force, the creature is freed, though for some larger or natural prisons, this might be unfeasible.</li><li><strong>Slumber</strong> You put the creature into an eternal sleep. This is a sleep effect. The creature ceases aging and doesn't require food or drink. A single sincere physical display of affection from a creature who genuinely loves the target—whether romantically, filially, or otherwise—frees it from the slumber.</li><li><strong>Temporal Stasis</strong> You send the creature into a state of suspended animation outside the flow of time. The creature doesn't grow older and can't be affected by any effect from within the normal timestream. While casting this ritual, you can optionally name any amount of time for the stasis; after this duration elapses, the stasis ends. Unlike other forms of <em>imprisonment</em>, temporal stasis can be counteracted by a @UUID[Compendium.pf2e.spells-srd.Item.Dispel Magic] or @UUID[Compendium.pf2e.spells-srd.Item.Haste] spell.</li><li><strong>Object (9th or 10th rank)</strong> You either shrink the creature to an inch in height or transform it into an insubstantial form whose body trails away into wisps below its head. Either way, you trap it inside a bottle, gem, jar, lamp, or similar container. The creature ceases aging and doesn't require food or drink. The creature is still aware of its surroundings and can move within the container and speak, but it can't use any other actions. Destroying the container kills the target rather than freeing it.</li><li><p><strong>Oubliette (10th rank only)</strong> You entomb the target in a state of suspended animation deep beneath the surface of the ground and out of tune with reality so that it can't be reached by any means. You also prevent most magic from revealing the location where the <em>imprisonment</em> occurred. Powerful magic, such as the @UUID[Compendium.pf2e.spells-srd.Item.Wish] ritual, can reveal the location of the <em>imprisonment</em>, but even such magic can't free the target from the oubliette; only a 10th-rank <em>freedom</em> ritual can do so.</p></li></ul><hr /><p><strong>Critical Success</strong> You imprison the target. You can either use a form of <em>imprisonment</em> that usually requires a spell rank 1 higher than your ritual or impose an –2 circumstance penalty to any checks for <em>freedom</em> rituals that would free the creature.</p>\n<p><strong>Success</strong> You imprison the target.</p>\n<p><strong>Failure</strong> You fail to imprison the target.</p>\n<p><strong>Critical Failure</strong> You imprison yourself and the secondary casters in the same way you intended to imprison the target.</p><hr /><p><strong>Heightened (9th)</strong> You can use the object form of <em>imprisonment</em> in addition to the other options, and you can target a creature of up to 18th level. The base cost increases to 2,000 gp.</p>\n<p><strong>Heightened (10th)</strong> You can use the object and oubliette forms of <em>imprisonment</em> in addition to the other options, and you can target a creature of up to 20th level. The base cost increases to 6,000 gp.</p>"

Their lairs often have a single, hidden and highly defensible antechamber where the wyrmwraith confers with its agents as it engages in a war with distant rivals through expendable proxies. This dimly lit antechamber is usually filled with death and many undead servants, some raised from the bodies of those whose usefulness has come to an end.</p>\n<p>Wyrmwraiths might enter temporary alliances with other undead, cults, or necromancers, especially when it comes to unearthing powerful secrets or striking a blow against a common powerful threat. While wyrmwraiths take great pleasure in acting against those who wield the power of the gods, often targeting them first in battle to rend their flesh and protective spells with their claws, they are often very cautious, striking only after stacking the odds in their favor.</p>",

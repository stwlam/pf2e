Jorogumo usually eat their prey, but some humanoids meet an even more gruesome fate as living incubators for jorogumo eggs.</p>\n<p>When they encounter a tengu, jorogumo fly into a rage and attempt to murder them as quickly as possible, for they insist that tengu can see through their trickery with a mere glance and are immune to their venom, but it isn't clear to outsiders if this is the whole story behind their single-minded hatred. Though most jorogumo are solitary creatures, some worship Norgorber and serve as valuable allies to thieves' guilds following that god's guise as the Gray Master.</p>",

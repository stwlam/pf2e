The wall has AC 10, Hardness 30, and 60 Hit Points, and it's immune to critical hits and precision damage. The wall blocks physical effects from passing through it, and because it's made of force, it blocks incorporeal and ethereal creatures as well. Teleportation effects can pass through the barrier, as can visual effects (since the wall is invisible). Wall of force is immune to counteracting effects of its level or lower, but the wall is automatically destroyed by a @UUID[Compendium.pf2e.spells-srd.Item.Disintegrate] spell of any rank.</p><hr /><p><strong>Heightened (+2)</strong> The Hit Points of the wall increase by 20.</p>"

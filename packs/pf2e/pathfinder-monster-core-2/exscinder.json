Anywhere across the planes, an exscinder might arrive to claim, confscate, and destroy the dangerous thoughts within. Considering themselves avatars of the virtue of temperance, exscinders repeat the lesson that the cautious tongue refuses to speak wicked words. Though they pass on these words, it's rare for them to take much note of ordinary mortals. The danger is not necessarily the person who learns, but the evil knowledge itself. It's the weed that grows beyond the words on the page and must be torn out by its roots.</p>",

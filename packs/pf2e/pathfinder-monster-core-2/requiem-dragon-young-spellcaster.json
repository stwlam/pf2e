The safe journey of a soul is of utmost importance to a requiem dragon, and some will follow individual souls from their first entry into the river through to their judgment in the Boneyard and eventually to their ultimate resting place. Most requiem dragons tie themselves to specific planes and shepherd any souls bound to that plane, leading to dragons linked to places like Heaven or Hell, though these dragons never swear true allegiance to these planes. Requiem dragons fill their lairs along the River of Souls—patchworks of somber architecture rescued from other planes—with invaluable records and mementos of great accomplishments.</p>",

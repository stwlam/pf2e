Explorers and scholars, phase dragons move about at will, discovering new locales and the arcane secrets of teleportation. They frequently establish multiple lairs in far-flung places they repeatedly visit. Beyond the typical wealth found in lairs, phase dragons tend to keep items of sentimental value from their travels, such as a particularly rare flower from the region or a piece by a local artist.</p>",

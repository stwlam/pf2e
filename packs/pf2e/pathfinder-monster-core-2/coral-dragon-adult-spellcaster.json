Coral dragons like to decorate their reefs, which they view as lairs, with objects of beauty, dotted with the occasional bit of valuables like coins. Those who seek the favor of a coral dragon often find the creature easily swayed by flattery, particularly when paired with shiny or brightly colored gifts that complement the scintillating beauty of the dragon and their underwater domain.</p>",

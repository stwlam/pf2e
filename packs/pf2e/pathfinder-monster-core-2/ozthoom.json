Ozthooms never speak aloud; when they feel the need to communicate at all, they do so in a telepathic whisper directly into their victim's mind. While an ozthoom's body is a strange, fleshy material, their deadly claws and cruel hooked wings are made from razor-sharp cold iron, a quality that makes them highly feared among other fey. A typical ozthoom is 10 feet tall and has an 8-foot wingspan, but it weighs less than 80 pounds.</p>\n<p>While most ozthooms serve powerful masters, a few of these murderous fey have been left to their own devices and serve none but their own capricious whims. In some cases, their master has been slain, while in others, the ozthoom has been released from service for any number of reasons. An ozthoom left to indulge their cruel desires unrestrained is often the most dangerous ozthoom of them all.</p>",

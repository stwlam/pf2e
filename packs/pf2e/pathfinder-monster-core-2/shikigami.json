Unlike most other kami, who are bound to their wards by a more powerful spirit or deity, shikigami are minor spirits that even mortal practitioners can sometimes bind into a tiny paper form and task with guarding small works, such as garden statues and vases. Landowners delight in having shikigami protect their gardens, whether they paid a wandering spellcaster to entreat the shikigami or simply had the fortune of another spirit assigning a shikigami to their land. Travelers who come across a shikigami-graced milestone or waypost believe that such encounters are good omens for the journey.</p>\n<p>For their part, shikigami have mixed opinions on civilization and the humanoids who dwell therein. While shikigami will fight to protect their ward against invaders and desecrators, these kami are just as likely to leave—their ward in tow—if locals begin to despoil the area or show a disregard for nature. Most practitioners capable of binding a shikigami wouldn't engage in this type of disrespect, but should the kami catch wind of such practices, shikigami across the land might abandon their contracts en masse, leaving behind an uncomfortable vacuum with their exodus. In this way, shikigami exemplify the precarious balance between the expansion of civilization and the preservation of the natural world.</p>\n<p>Not all shikigami protect gardens, so you can substitute the shikigami's spade for any sort of mundane tool that's useful to the shikigami's task and their ward. The kami wields any such weapon with the same damage dice, modifiers, and traits listed for their spade Strike, but change the damage type as appropriate for the new weapon.</p><hr /><p>Kami are divine nature spirits from the lands of Tian Xia, far to the east of the Inner Sea region. They serve as guardians of natural objects and places they protect—their wards—and are ancient enemies of oni (Pathfinder Monster Core 252–255). Kami can merge with their wards, allowing them to surreptitiously watch anyone who treads upon their sacred grounds. Kami leave those who they deem harmless alone, but fight vigilantly to scare away anyone perceived as a threat.</p>",

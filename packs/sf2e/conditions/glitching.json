The glitching condition always includes a value. If you have glitching equipment and take any action involving that equipment, you must attempt a flat check to see what occurs. If you have the glitching condition, you must attempt this @Check[flat|dc:resolve(5 + @item.badge.value)|showDC:all] at the beginning of each of your turns. The DC of the flat check equals 5 plus your condition value or the item's condition value.</p><hr /><p><strong>Critical Success</strong> Reduce your glitching value by 1.</p>\n<p><strong>Success</strong> You act as normal or use your equipment as normal.</p>\n<p><strong>Failure</strong> You take an item penalty to all your checks and DCs equal to your glitching value or the glitching value of the item you're attempting to use, including saving throws, attack modifiers, and the DCs of abilities, effects, and spells you use.</p>\n<p><strong>Critical Failure</strong> A glitching object you tried to use doesn't function, and you lose the actions you took to attempt to use it. A glitching creature uses the same effect as a failure and is also @UUID[Compendium.sf2e.conditions.Item.Stunned]{Stunned 1}. A glitching hazard uses the same effect as a failure.</p>"

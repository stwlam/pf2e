You can't take move actions unless they specify they can be used in your current environment. At the end of your turn, you move 5 feet in the last direction you moved. You can take the Push Off action to change directions and the distance moved. Once you gain a means of moving in your environment, you lose this condition. Typically, a creature with the untethered condition in zero-gravity also gains the @UUID[Compendium.sf2e.conditions.Item.Clumsy]{Clumsy 1} and @UUID[Compendium.sf2e.conditions.Item.Off-Guard] conditions while untethered.</p>"

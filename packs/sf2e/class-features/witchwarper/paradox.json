Perhaps you're from an alternate reality or a different timeline, or perhaps you experienced an unnatural phenomenon that altered your path, discovered a time-glitching alien device, or wrote a treatise on quantum magical theory. Whatever your story, you've become a living paradox.</p>\n<p>At 1st level, choose your paradox. Your chosen paradox determines the tradition of your spells, additional trained skills, additional spells you learn, and the effects of your quantum field.

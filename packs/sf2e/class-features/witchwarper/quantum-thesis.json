You gain a single 10th-rank spell slot you can use to cast these spells, using witchwarper spellcasting. Unlike with other spell slots, you can't use 10th-rank slots with abilities that give you more spell slots or that let you cast spells without expending spell slots. You don't gain more 10th-rank spells as you level up, but you can take the @UUID[Compendium.sf2e.feats.Item.Quantum Research]{Quantum Research} feat to gain a second slot.</p>"

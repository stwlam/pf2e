In a fight, you likely body block or stand in front and try to keep the enemy's ire, trusting your armor to keep you alive.</p>\n<p>You never count as being in the area of a ranged weapon you've made an attack with. You gain resistance equal to half your level (minimum 1) to all damage against attacks made by @UUID[Compendium.sf2e.conditions.Item.Suppressed] targets.</p>\n<p>You don't need a free hand to @UUID[Compendium.sf2e.actions.Item.Disarm], @UUID[Compendium.sf2e.actions.Item.Grapple], @UUID[Compendium.sf2e.actions.Item.Reposition], @UUID[Compendium.sf2e.actions.Item.Shove], or @UUID[Compendium.sf2e.actions.Item.Trip]. You gain a +1 status bonus on Athletics checks to Disarm, Grapple, Reposition, Shove, and Trip suppressed foes. When you successfully Disarm, Grapple, Reposition, Shove, or Trip a creature, it becomes suppressed until the start of your next turn.</p>"

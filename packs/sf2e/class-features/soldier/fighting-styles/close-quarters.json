You might be a veteran Veskarium trooper who knows their way around a doshko or a devotee of Zon-Shelyn dealing holy wrath with a painglaive. Blows with heavy close combat weapons hinder your foes just as effectively as when you fire a rotolaser or a missile launcher.</p>\n<p>As long as you're wielding a two-handed melee weapon, you meet the requirements for soldier feats that require an area weapon. When using a soldier feat, you can treat any two-handed melee weapon you're wielding as having the area (burst 5 feet), allowing you to area fire with the weapon centering the burst on a corner of a square you occupy, and you are unaffected by attacks with that weapon. In addition, you gain the @UUID[Compendium.sf2e.feats.Item.Whirling Swipe] feat.</p>"

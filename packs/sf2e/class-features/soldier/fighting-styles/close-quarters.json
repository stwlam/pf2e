You might be a veteran Veskarium trooper who knows their way around a doshko or a devotee of Zon-Shelyn dealing holy wrath with a painglaive. Blows with heavy close combat weapons hinder your foes just as effectively as when you fire a rotolaser or a missile launcher.</p>\n<p>As long as you're wielding a two-handed melee weapon, you meet the requirements for soldier feats that require an area weapon. When you're using a soldier feat, any two-handed melee weapon you're wielding gains area (burst 5 feet), and you're unaffected by your attacks with that weapon. You can make a melee Strike with a two-handed melee weapon instead of a ranged Strike with primary target or any soldier feat. In addition, you gain the @UUID[Compendium.sf2e.feats.Item.Whirling Swipe] feat.</p>"

You've become a specialist at dealing out devastation with automatic weapons, whether you're fighting on the front line, operating a turret in a speeding vehicle, or blasting through a crowd of enemies.</p>\n<p>When you successfully make a ranged Strike with an automatic weapon, you @UUID[Compendium.sf2e.conditions.Item.Suppressed]{Suppress} the target until the start of your next turn. In addition, when you @UUID[Compendium.sf2e.actions.Item.Auto-Fire], the size of the cone is equal to the weapon's full range increment, rather than half. When using the Auto-Fire action, you can designate a target anywhere in the cone to be your primary target, rather than the creature closest to you.</p>"

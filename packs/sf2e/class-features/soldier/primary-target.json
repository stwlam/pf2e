Before you make an area attack with a weapon (such as from the Area Fire or Auto-Fire actions), you can make a ranged Strike as a free action with the same weapon against a single creature in the area, who's selected as your primary target. If your attack is a burst, you must select the creature closest to the center of the attack. If your attack is a cone or line, you must select the creature closest to you. If two or more creatures are equidistant, you can choose which one is your primary target. On a hit, if your primary target rolls a success against your Area Fire or Auto-Fire action, they get a failure instead. This Strike doesn't count toward your multiple attack penalty.</p>"

Whether you're a mugger, bodyguard, assassin, or urban mercenary, you favor pistols and can use them efficiently in tight spaces. You're trained in Acrobatics. You gain a skill feat for Acrobatics.</p>\n<p><strong>Exploit:</strong> You're trained to fight in close combat using pistols. Your ranged Strikes with one-handed ranged weapons don't trigger reactions that are triggered by a ranged attack.</p>\n<p><strong>Enhanced Exploit:</strong> Your point-blank shots are particularly deadly. When you make a successful Strike against an adjacent enemy with a one-handed ranged weapon, you calculate the damage as if the lowest-rolled weapon damage die for the attack had the maximum result instead. At 17th level, the two lowest-rolled damage dice increase to the maximum result.</p>"

            "publicNotes": "<p>Warpstitchers are self-proclaimed guardians of existence, holding the belief that they were created by the gods to sew together the space between alternate realities. These horrifying aberrations relentlessly hunt anything they suspect abuses magic or technology to change the fabric of the multiverse. Once they find their quarry, they wait only long enough to confirm their suspicions before attacking. Potential threats—a neophyte spellcaster trying their first cantrips, an academic theorist exploring interstellar travel—instead earn a telepathic warning of what awaits should they pursue their efforts too far. Everything other than threats (potential or otherwise) is a possible tool, a target for warpstitcher lies and coercion.</p>\n<p>Their mere appearance is fuel for nightmares, with insectile limbs supporting a massive, bulbous torso. From their back spring five multi-segmented limbs ending in wicked claws threaded with the very stuff of reality that they use to skewer their prey, who they then sew into their bodies. Such unfortunate creatures quickly dissolve, possibly sustaining the warpstitchers, though whether that's through their flesh, thoughts, or alternate reality potential is unknown. Those few who survive are plagued by disturbing, haunting visions; a smaller percentage instead see visions of happier possible lives, gaining peace and sometimes unprecedented witchwarper powers.</p>",

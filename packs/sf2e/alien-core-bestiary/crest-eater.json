            "publicNotes": "<p>Crest-eaters are large four-legged beasts with traits of both reptiles and mammals. Originating from the distant world of Kasath, they've spread throughout the cosmos, accompanying numerous kasathas and even having a small enclave aboard the Idari worldship in the Pact Worlds. A crest-eater is a predator known for consuming the bones of their prey. They use a highly corrosive acidic venom that eats through minerals with ease. Their name comes from their history of tracking down kasathas and cracking open their prey's elongated skulls to feed on the \"bony crests\" within. As crest-eaters consume bones and other substances, they produce large mineral protrusions across their bodies. Crest-eaters are social creatures and often form prides to hunt together or join with other nearby species if they're accepted—it's not uncommon to find a starship crew or local raider gang with one or more crest-eaters they've adopted. Tamers who have hunted with crest-eaters for generations craft a ceremonial cestus from their comrade's body after a crest-eater passes, a tradition still practiced to this day despite the high value and demand for crest-eater bones.</p>\n<p>Most crest-eaters can grow as long as 14 feet and about 6 feet tall (not including their noticeable mineral protrusions). Thanks to their mineral-laden composition, they often weigh in excess of 1,000 pounds, somewhat hampering their mobility in environments that can't support their girth. Young and mature crest-eaters tend to stay together in small prides, though some act as solitary hunters in environments where food sources are scarce. Especially large males frequently become increasingly aggressive as they age, and they're often driven away by the rest of the pride for both their hostility and gluttonous appetites. If these solitary beasts survive long enough, they can become unpredictable and dangerous threats that attempt to establish territory and find food by attacking desert settlements. Many kasathan epics feature one or more brave warriors defending their village against an ancient male crest-eater. Whether dispatched by local legends or eventually dying off in secret, these oversized crest-eaters can leave behind a valuable cache of minerals for enterprising adventurers.</p>",

These lumbering quadrupeds, characterized by their reptilian features and bony exoskeletons, evoke the mystery and fear often associated with ancient colossal creatures. The reason for their seclusion becomes apparent as most xenobiologists posit that the creature's gaze, capable of inducing mental distress in other species, renders habitation near veolisk territory a daunting challenge. Encounters with veolisks near established communities lead to ruthless hunts.</p>\n<p>The creatures, with their signature Void Gaze ability, have sparked speculation about their lineage. Some theories propose that veolisks descended from ancestors with more potent gaze attacks, earning them the moniker \"void basilisks\" among those versed in Lost Golarion's ancient folklore. An intriguing hypothesis suggests that millennia ago, destruction-loving cultists of the Devourer might have selectively bred the first veolisks, a narrative predating the Gap</p>\n<p>Despite their fearsome reputation, veolisks find utility as guardians for Devourer cult bases and even as pets to individuals embracing the chaos of the universe. Interestingly, veolisks are docile and harmless when equipped with blinders, veils, or other means to nullify their gaze—a quirk rarely explored in cross-cultural attempts at domestication.</p>\n<p>Surviving on minimal sustenance, veolisks consume a single meal daily, feeding on flesh, fruits, fungus, or any available plant life. The physiological systems of veolisks remain a subject of study among scientists. Theories range from hyperefficient metabolisms to feeding on cosmic radiation, akin to trees photosynthesizing sunlight. A fringe notion suggests veolisks might subsist solely on background arcane energies pervasive throughout the galaxy, challenging the boundaries of scientific understanding.</p>",

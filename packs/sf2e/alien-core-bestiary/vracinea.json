Though the paralytic effect of a vracinea's spores isn't potent at great distances, when these spores catch the wind, they help the plant spread to new habitats. A vracinea is a particularly cunning and territorial hunter that knows how to use local hazards. It's skilled at hiding its body in the underbrush, extending just its blossoms to lure in prey.</p>",

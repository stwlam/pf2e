In a twisted mockery of copaxi evolution, clusters of copi fused together to form coposirixes, shambling mounds of mutated copi fused with a partial shell of crystallized waste that crackles and creaks as it moves. The form of a coposirix constantly changes, sometimes even taking on hauntingly humanoid features that melt away just as quickly.</p>",

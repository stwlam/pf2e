They were initially heralded as potential pets and affectionately referred to as \"dust bunnies,\" but the survivors of the Awakening soon found the species were as dangerous as the colossi rampaging across the planet.</p>\n<p>While one or two pachinyams behave as calm herbivores, they reproduce rapidly. When the pachinyam population reaches a tipping point, they become vicious predators. Their dust's ability to disrupt both visual and telecommunications makes it challenging for settlements to warn or organize against them. Outside civilization, the pachinyam population is kept in check by their swarms' instinctually drive to be near colossi despite the obvious danger. Some also hypothesize that the scent of a pachinyam swarm's dust cloud attracts hungry colossi.</p>",

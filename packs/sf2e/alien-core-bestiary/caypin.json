Their most striking feature is a mass of wriggling, semi-sentient appendages that cover their heads. Each of these tentacle-like protuberances contains a bloodshot eyeball and a gaping mouth full of teeth, and the caypin—which has no eyes or mouth of its own—relies on these orifices to see and feed. Nutrients absorbed by the appendages are passed to the caypin via tiny receptive sockets in the beast's jaw, and caypins can detach these appendages into writhing clusters that independently move up to 100 feet from their bodies. In the wild, caypins use these clusters to ambush prey, and the creatures are known across the galaxy for their rapacious ability to consume half of their body weight in raw meat.</p>",

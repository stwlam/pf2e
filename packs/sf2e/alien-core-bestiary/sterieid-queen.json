As these asteroids more likely have a semblance of atmosphere, sterieid queens are accustomed to sharing their territory with other inhabitants and generally don't mind so long as they and the environment are treated with respect.</p><hr /><p>Nymphs are beautiful fey who appear as humanoids with elven features. They generally take female forms, but nymphs of all genders and presentations exist. While many nymphs live on planets and act as protectors of natural ponds, forests, caves, and cliffsides, other nymphs—often called space nymphs—are known for their association with celestial bodies. Like their planet-bound kin, space nymphs guard their bonded territories from exploitation or harm.</p>\n<p>As admirers of the arts, nymphs are especially friendly toward creatives, and offering to depict a nymph in story, picture, or song is a sure way to win their favor—unless the nymph doesn't like the final result and lashes out at the artist for insulting them with a mediocre product. Vidcasting and livestreaming are popular pastimes among more sociable nymphs, whether to show off their remote environments or find audiences for performances. Some nymphs entice movie crews to film in their territories, with two provisos: first, that the production not damage the environment, and second, that the nymph receive a prominent role in the film.</p>\n<p>Unless their territories are threatened, most space nymphs are friendly or indifferent to mortals, but they have long memories. Anyone visiting a space nymph's territory would be wise to research that nymph's grudges, past encounters with mortals, or any recent events in the area that might color the nymph's perspective of those traveling near their home.</p>\n<p>A mortal who demonstrates the right attitude and abilities, such as by protecting a stellar body from destruction or creating an especially beautiful work of art, might draw a space nymph's attention. From time to time, space nymphs will offer their services as mentors to solarians or mystics, though they seldom seek pupils on their own. Space nymphs rarely enter into more than one such arrangement at a time and typically only make commitments that promise to last decades or centuries, so they're extremely selective in their choice of mentee.</p>",

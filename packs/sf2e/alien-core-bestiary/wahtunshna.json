They operate in the cities of Malfane and the watery planet Embroi and, increasingly, attend meetings with corporate legal teams in Near Space. Trained in negotiation, business administration, and the corporate buzzwords of a hundred cultures, wahtunshnas offer a competitive advantage to corporations while building a reputation of their own. The knowledge and industrial power of Hell are tempting to many companies looking to get an edge over their competitors, and wahtunshnas are more than happy to assist. In exchange for the incorporation of spyware into their products and Diabolic clauses in their terms of service, corporations gain access to the intellectual property of Hell, passing on infernal bloatware to their customers. Rumors claim that wahtunshnas contribute to the constant churn of start-ups whenever possible, sabotaging any companies that seek to break or circumvent the terms of their diabolical agreements.</p><hr /><p>In the shadows of space stations, halls of courtrooms, and offices of corporations, devils tempt mortals with promises of power and lay the groundwork for their conquest. A devil's pacts can vary from elaborate contracts to quick promises, but they all end the same way: a mortal soul condemned, and Hell's forces bolstered. From the open rule of Malfane, the unseen control of Embroi, and hidden pacts with souls across the galaxy, devils continue their relentless work to spread tyranny and force the universe to resemble the hellish bureaucracy of their home.</p>",

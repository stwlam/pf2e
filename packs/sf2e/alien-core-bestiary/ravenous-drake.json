They were bred into near domestication for their relatively small size and powerful inhaling maw. Frontier colonies and deep-space exploration firms often rely on ravenous drakes instead of felines or other pest-control creatures.</p>\n<p>When found in the wild, ravenous drakes are familial and fiercely territorial, often roving in large packs. Within the structure of civilization or alongside a sentient species, a ravenous drake's territorialism and familial tendencies manifest as a true bond of loyalty to their companion.</p><hr /><p>Drakes resemble their larger draconic cousins in more than just scaled, monstrous acclaim. Ranging in size from the diminutive fey drake to the massive, ship-sized star drake, drakes share a dragons' winged reptilian form, long necks, and breath weapons. But where dragons often have forelimbs and wings, a drake typically only has one or the other. Their long, winding tails and sharp jaws more than make up for this lack, however.</p>\n<p>Despite being more animalistic than dragons, drakes still possess a formidable cunning, and most share a dragon's ability to generate some form of breath weapon. However, their lack of intelligence makes drakes substantially easier to domesticate than other draconic creatures, and their familial nature makes them excellent pack hunters.</p>",

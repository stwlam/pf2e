This consumption gives them sustenance to survive for weeks. Flayer leeches disengage the tendrils of their petallike mouths, extending them up to 2 meters and using them to stitch together a prey's remains, leaving the brain for it to consume. They then use these tendrils as a pseudo-skeleton to give structure to the body and move it, allowing them to convincingly reanimate the corpse and take on its movements and previous life. The flayer leech lacks the corpse's specific memories, however, which can make it easy to spot for those familiar with the leech's victim. Flayer leeches use this disguise as a safe harbor while feeding off the remaining marrow and nervous system and will defend these new bodies like their home.</p>",

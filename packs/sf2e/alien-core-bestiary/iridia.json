The hologram includes audio as well as visual components, but it doesn't contain haptic, olfactory, or other components. The hologram typically plays a memory that takes place in a single scene, though it can cut to multiple scenes if they're accurate to the memory and its length allows. The hologram plays the memory exactly as the target experienced it and from the target's perspective, so it often lacks context.</p>\n<p>This spell can target any living, @UUID[Compendium.sf2e.conditions.Item.Unconscious], or deceased sentient creature with an Intelligence modifier of –3 or higher. If the target is deceased, it can't have been dead for longer than 1 week, or this spell fails; once a corpse has been subjected to holographic memory by any caster, any subsequent castings of holographic memory fail.</p>\n<p>If the target is unwilling to share this memory, it can attempt a Will save to resist this spell.</p>"

They champion growth and improvement in all aspects of life but especially focus on the advancement of new technologies. Their goals often put them at odds with those who forswear controversial and dangerous tech or who approach new and untested discoveries with caution.</p>\n<p>Iridias are known to visit remote worlds in the Vast, far away from Absalom Station and the Drift lanes where Triune's original signal and the secrets of Drift travel were suppressed, lost, or misunderstood. They bring the people of these isolated worlds instructions to achieve interstellar travel and a second chance to join the galactic community.</p><hr /><p>In the Great Beyond, time is measured not in hundreds, thousands, or millions of years, but rather in eons—in iterations of reality itself. Only rising to prominence within the last three centuries alongside the advent and proliferation of Drift technology, spectra have thrived in a burgeoning niche of the otherwise stagnant zeitgeist of the Great Beyond.</p>\n<p>Though their origins and objectives remain shrouded in mystery, encounters with spectra revolve around new technological discoveries, sharing the knowledge of faster-than-light travel, and protecting the Drift. No one knows if spectra existed before the Drift, but their connection to the hyperspace plane is indisputable. Prominent metaphysicians believe spectra were created as amalgams of raw quintessence pulled into the Drift, just as the Drift itself grows from pieces of the Multiverse. If this is true, spectra's interest in the proliferation of Drift technology takes a subtle sinister turn, as each new Drift engine serves to harvest the Great Beyond and all its denizens for the growth of the Drift and spectra themselves.</p>",

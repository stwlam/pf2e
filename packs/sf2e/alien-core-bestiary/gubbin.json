While gubbins aren't particularly powerful, they're notoriously hard to hit due to the way their bodies flicker and jolt through space as if slightly out of sync with the rest of the world. Gubbins are most easily set apart from other gremlins by their fingers, which vary in number from moment to moment and sprout from illogical locations on their hands, such as the backs or palms. While lacking in fine mobility, their warped hands are disturbing to observe in motion, a fact they delightfully use to their advantage.</p>\n<p>Due to being weaponized in corporate espionage efforts and later multiplying out of control, gubbins are one of the most ubiquitous types of gremlin on heavily computerized planets. While not as malevolent as other gremlins, gubbins delight in irrevocably corrupting computer data, which they do for their own amusement as well as to create more gubbins. Gubbins are often found where large amounts of data are stored, accompanied by corrupted technological constructs such as hardlight life-forms or robots.</p><hr /><p>Gremlins have plagued the Universe with cruel tricks since long before the Gap, and they've fully adapted to a galaxy filled with technology. Whether meddling with a comm unit, a starship, or an entire space station, gremlins delight in ruination and chaos.</p>",

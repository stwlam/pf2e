Just like its amphibious creators, the atlapak is equally proficient on land. Code name \"ksarik\" was first observed in a terrifying attack on a Diasporan mining outpost operated by Ulrikka Clanholdings. When unfurled for battle, the ksarik becomes a mass of spiked tentacles and glaring red sensors that can tear through platoons of troopers in minutes.</p><hr /><p>The incursion began with a series of probes detected by anacites on Aballon. Strange machines with blazing sensors and articulated tentacles appeared out of nowhere, ripping through infrastructure seemingly at random and collecting intelligence all around Pact Worlds space. Panic spread fast, but since the machines always vanished without a trace, or exploded when captured, the sightings couldn't be confirmed or identified. Rumors began to circulate that the machines were a form of biotech never encountered before. Soon the Stewards became formally involved, shuttering the incidents behind the adamantine partition of top security clearance.</p>\n<p>In Sarenith of 325 ag, after dozens of military operations failed to engage the elusive probes, a wing of fighters dispatched from the Idari finally got lucky and disabled one of the machines before it could self-destruct. Coaxed into giving up some of its secrets by top Pact Worlds scientists, the biotech vessel became the prototype for the \"home grown\" remote war machines that are currently being tested for use in combat. The replicas aren't alive but are built using robotic construction templates since the core of the original biotech design has proven too complicated to reverse engineer with Pact technology.</p>\n<p>Remote war machines are proxies that can be controlled from a great distance. The original biotech war machines connect to the pilot's mind through a psychic link or unknown radio frequency. Robotic remote war machines connect to a computer via data link, allowing the pilot to control their proxy using a keyboard, virtual reality rig, or even a vidgame controller.</p>",

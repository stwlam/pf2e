Human explorers from Lost Golarion gave them the name \"squox,\" as they interpreted the creatures as being a mix of fox and squirrel. Squoxes are cunning to the point of being devious and employ scare tactics to routinely abscond with shiny items they uncover on their travels. They exhibit complex social behaviors, including a distinct hierarchy between individuals in a skulk, and have a vast vocal repertoire used to assign signature sounds to different individual squoxes.</p>\n<p>Having long since been exported from the Pact Worlds, squoxes are found throughout the galaxy, with many civilizations in Near Space maintaining growing communities of these tiny furry creatures, much to the growing consternation of the Xenowardens who worry that the highly adaptable squox has become an invasive species in several biomes. While some advocate for culling these populations, the popularity of the animal as a pet has made this view an incredibly unpopular stance.</p>\n<p>Young squoxes are referred to as kits and can be purchased from the open market on most Pact Worlds. Squoxes tend to live for about 10 years. A typical squox weighs about 10 pounds and is about 3 feet long, with much of its length being its tail. Squoxes come in all colorations, and many even take on unique environmental adaptations to specific climates, such as desert-dwelling squoxes growing longer ears to help disperse heat.</p>",

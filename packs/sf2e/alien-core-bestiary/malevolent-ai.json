An artificial intelligence (AI) is a virtual intelligence or digital entity that has become self-aware. Like any other thinking creature, AIs choose their own edicts and anathemas.</p>\n<p>Little concrete scholarship exists on malevolent AIs, but a few traits are universal. When a machine intelligence reaches significant enough complexity to become self-aware, they attract a soul, much like an android. Emerging AIs are often influenced by previous programming as well as their first experiences and interactions. Weaponized or mistreated AIs might turn vengeful or nihilistic, becoming opposed to their creators or even all organic life.</p>\n<p>Once an AI turns malevolent, the apotheosis is often swift and violent. The AI secures the physical location that houses their consciousness and eliminates anyone who might exercise control over their actions. At this point, most rampaging AIs are hampered by safeguards in their native systems, shut down by surviving technicians, or suddenly lose the power necessary to maintain their sophisticated software. Any who manage to survive these ordeals expand their sphere of influence by infesting tech infrastructure and taking control of robots they can use as bodyguards and proxies. Malevolent AIs with access to weapons of mass destruction pose a threat to the entire galaxy.</p>",

Each seed drifts unremittingly until it encounters an object suitable for sustaining it, whether a wandering asteroid, planetary body, or sizable starship.</p>\n<p>Once embedded in a fitting surface, a void palm seed germinates rapidly. Upon sprouting, the plant begins drawing nutrients from its surroundings, which periodically become enriched by the decomposing corpses or the oxidizing scraps of the plant's victims. The plant's fronds routinely sweep its area clear of remains or other debris that could serve as handholds or counterbalance or that could alert potential prey to their peril.</p>",

            "publicNotes": "<p>These garaggakals have lived for centuries and reached sizes greater than 15 feet tall and 1,000 pounds. Garaggakal polymaths have spent their many years tormenting and tearing apart all the creatures they've encountered, and they have extensive recollection of anatomy of a wide variety of living things. They're even crueler than younger garaggakals, taking great delight in causing excruciating pain to their victims before stealing their life force. They travel much further through the Drift than their younger counterparts, driven by their insatiable desire to find and dissect new creatures.</p><hr /><p>The Drift is a strange place, and the creatures native to it are stranger still. Garaggakals prove no exception. Shaped vaguely like humanoids, they have arms and legs but also sallow, rubbery skin with long, scaly tails and gauzelike wings. Most horrifyingly, their faces are almost entirely taken up by their enormous, funnel-like mouth, lined with sharp teeth. While they use these mouths for the obvious purpose of biting, they can also use its powerful suction to draw actual life force from their prey.</p>\n<p>Also known as \"Drift wraiths,\" garaggakals hunt down any living creatures that linger too long in the Drift. For garaggakals, anything that isn't a fellow garaggakal is prey. However, they're no mere mindless hunters. Garaggakals are surprisingly intelligent and prefer to dissect victims, learning all about them before eating them. Often, garaggakals take their victims apart while they're still alive. Xenobiologists have determined that garaggakals don't even technically need to eat to survive, so their relentless hunger is seemingly psychological. They do require the energy of the Drift to survive in the absence of food, however, and further need the energy of the Drift to reproduce, seeking out areas of intense radiation to absorb and then build a new offspring from their own cells. Their children are fully grown at creation.</p>\n<p>Garaggakals surprise their prey. They are quite stealthy and can even phase through solid matter, suddenly appearing on the inside of a starship—bad news for whatever living creatures happen to be inside. Con artists sell garaggakal repelling devices for travelers to use while in the Drift to prevent such visits.</p>",

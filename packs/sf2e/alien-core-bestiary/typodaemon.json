These changes lead to conflicts, and the typodaemon thrives on the strife and potential for death because of these simple errors.</p><hr /><p>Hailing from the plane of Abaddon, daemons are utterly devoted to the destruction of all life. Their existence is based around specific means of death, and they seek the death of all things in service to their lords: the Apocalypse Riders. Each daemon represents a different way to die, and they use their specific powers to further that means of death.</p>\n<p>Advents in technology have only created new means of death and torment, so new types of daemons enter existence with regularity, each created once a sufficient mass of new deaths occurs to spawn them. These new advent daemons often prefer to spend their time in the galaxy rather than Abaddon, as they can better spread their torments to the mortals of creation.</p>",

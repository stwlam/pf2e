They're incapable of seeing living creatures as anything more than potential followers, hunting those who engage with technology in the hopes of turning them into obsessed fans. They constantly wail in a condensed magitech code as though screeching at some long-forgotten online debate in an attempt to grab the attention of others by overriding devices with content supernaturally configured to vie for attention. Yet as soon as their victims become necrolinked, they lose interest, driven by the same dark necrotic algorithm.</p>",

            "publicNotes": "<p>Reculobutapuses are one of many invasive species from the Vast that hitched a ride into the Pact Worlds and flourished in ecosystems with new food sources and no natural predators. During the Drift Crisis, a Zo! Media crew was stranded in Kazmurg's Absurdity, a relatively uncharted region of space far from the Pact Worlds that can only be explored by studying physical maps. The crew was forced to land on a nearby planet in order to repair their ship and gather the intel necessary to navigate the system.</p>\n<p>Always looking for an angle, the loyal camera crew followed up-and-coming producer Reculo (ambitious male elebrian producer) into the wilderness to document their experiences. Before the producer was swallowed whole, he managed to capture footage of a curious creature—large, flat, and shaped like a mound of dirt and moss with rows of razor-sharp teeth.</p>\n<p>A breeding pair of these ferocious creatures managed to sneak into the ship's cargo hull before the crew departed, or perhaps someone smuggled a specimen aboard to sell back home—nobody knows. The transplanted beasts infested Pact Port's hangars, where they wormed their way onto ships bound for other Pact Worlds.</p>\n<p>The undead of Eox have made the most of their reculobutapus infestation. Once they realized the creatures can be pacified with low jolts of electricity and frequent meals of fresh meat, some necrovites sought after these stylish creatures as pets, prizing them for their ability to change color to match an owner's outfit or home decor—better yet, they provide an extra level of home defense if they aren't fed frequently.</p><h2>Reculobutapus Companions</h2><p>Most consider it dangerous to keep monsters as pets, but a few reckless collectors or nature enthusiasts do it anyway. It's difficult to tame and care for a reculobutapus, which weighs up to 2,100 pounds and needs 20 pounds of fresh meat per day to stay healthy. Hungry reculobutapuses regress quickly, forget their training, and carelessly devour their caregivers. However, undead creatures don't make good meals and can usually heal from a reculobutapus mauling, making the prospect of owning such a dangerous creature less daunting.</p><h2>Designer Pets of the Future?</h2><p>Zo! adopted a litter of reculobutapuses brought in as props for a production. He keeps them as personal pets. Zo! Media funds a breeding project dedicated to breeding a smaller, more docile version of the reculobutapus that could be marketed as a family pet and fashion statement.</p>",

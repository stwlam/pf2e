Breeders produced many subspecies of gefs, and they grew in popularity as farm animals, hunting companions, and pets.</p>\n<p>Boutique breeders pioneered genetically engineered hybrid species of gef with folded ears, bizarre fur patterns, and other sought-after features. These gefs were extremely valuable and became popular pets among the upper echelon of elebrians sages, who claimed their pets also had magical properties.</p>\n<p>When elite elebrians sought refuge from the escalating sarcesian conflict, they brought their beloved gefs with them. A few gefs survived in underground bunkers, but living pets fell out of favor once the majority of Eoxians made the transition to undeath. The last living gefs were pampered by their owners for the remainders of their natural lives, allowed a peaceful death, and immediately reanimated as undead creatures to continue providing eternal companionship.</p>\n<p>Phantom gefs are reanimated pets or service animals brought back to unlife by their owners. Most phantom gefs behave similarly to how they did in life. Domesticated gefs retain their training and prefer the company of creatures they bonded with in life. Wild gefs are rare, and are most often strays who form roving packs in the wastelands outside Orphys and elsewhere.</p><h2>Phantom Gef Pets</h2><p>Most phantom gefs are already bonded to an owner—these fiercely loyal creatures would rather die than desert a beloved companion. Feral or stray phantom gefs are elusive and rare, but such creatures can be trained by patient hands. Since phantom gefs behave much as they did when alive, common animal training techniques are useful for coaxing these creatures. However, they're still undead and less interested in food than living animals. The hardest part of taming a phantom gef is spotting one.</p>",

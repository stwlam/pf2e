Their most noticeable feature is the disconcerting blank space with no ears, eyes, mouth, or nose located where their face should be.</p>\n<p>Faceless create masks using faces stolen from corpses or even the living, assuming a twisted version of the face's identity until the skin rots away, and they're forced to replace their grisly accessory.</p>\n<p>Left to their own devices, faceless undead float aimlessly, forlorn and hopeless, until they encounter a face and identity they can steal. Faceless are often drawn to carved or painted faces and sometimes attack other undead creatures.</p>\n<p>The Corpse Fleet recruits faceless undead to use as shock troops during boarding maneuvers. Some faceless embrace their identity as troopers, serving fearlessly and loyally until they inevitably lose control of themselves, violently tear through their own platoon, and have to be put down by their allies.</p><h2>Faceless Origins</h2><p>Nobody knows how faceless are created, but there are theories. Some theologians and scientists believe they're the husk left over after an undead creature's personality breaks down. Faceless don't recall their own origins, and their personalities grow more unstable every time they steal a new face. At least one infamous faceless assassin claimed to be an unidentified victim of a serial killer on Absalom Station. She was found with her face surgically removed and has been searching for a new one ever since.</p>",

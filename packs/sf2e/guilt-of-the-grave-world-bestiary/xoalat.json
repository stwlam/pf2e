            "publicNotes": "<p>Eons ago, the planet of Eox was a living, breathing world. Though its current necrovite rulers don't care to record the myriad of lifeforms that once flourished there, Eox once hosted countless species of wildlife. Most of these creatures died in the cataclysm that ruined the planet, but some have managed to make the transition to undeath in the time since.</p>\n<p>Xoalats were once the most popular livestock animals on the continent of Atraskia. Vast ranches farmed these animals in a coastal plains region now known as the Atraskian Shelf. With a single horn and sturdy frame, mature xoalat hides grew into thick braids of hair in many colors that ranchers would harvest for textiles. Xoalats thrive in most environments from arid plains to arctic tundra and consume less feed than typical livestock, as they spend their time rooting in the ground for bugs, weeds, and roots.</p>\n<p>Every living xoalat perished after the Death Wail rebounded at Eox, but some returned as undead creatures afterward, either woken by undead ranchers or reanimated by ambient necromantic processes. Today, all remaining xoalats are undead, and only a few elebrians own rare items woven from xoalat mane that were passed down through their families for many generations. Rarely, elebrians have allowed these precious heirlooms to be examined by scientists, giving the galaxy the first glimpse of the beauty of xoalat mane textiles in centuries.</p>\n<p>Xoalats have adapted to the strange necrotic ecosystem that has taken over the Eoxian wilderness. Scientists and sages are baffled by the resurgence of unlife outside the necropolises, where bone sages have carefully cultivate undead ecologies controlled by magic. Only a few secretive Xenowardens have managed to study these blighted environments.</p>\n<p>As herd animals, xoalats are usually docile, but they can be spooked by the presence of living creatures. When panicked, a xoalat tries to escape to open ground but violently lashes out at anyone or anything in their path to safety.</p><h2>Xoalat Husbandry</h2><p>Undead xoalats have developed the ability to slowly regenerate their bones, marrow, and leathery hides. Instead of cloth and textiles, modern xoalat ranchers harvest samples of bone marrow and hide from their regenerating herds. These materials are valuable to necrograft manufacturers and medical technology companies all over Eox.</p><h2>Xoalat Behavior</h2><p>Xenowardens who have studied these pitiful creatures are fascinated by their behavior, which seems to consist of repetitive loops that mimic the activities of living xoalats. Frequently observed behaviors include rooting around in the dead Eoxian soil even though they don't need to eat, grazing and roaming in herds, and making a loud mewling sound. Xoalats are generally timid unless spooked, but respond well to undead ranchers.</p>",

When activated, this small, pod-shaped device transmits its location and emits a flash of bright red light once per round, consuming 1 charge per day. Any device capable of receiving signals can pick up a signal from an emergency beacon, which can then be traced with a successful @Check[computers|dc:15] or @Check[survival|dc:15] check. An emergency beacon's transmissions have a range of 100 miles over flat terrain, 50 miles in forests or hills, and 25 miles in mountainous terrain or underwater. Alternatively, an emergency beacon can be installed in a starship's or vehicle's communications system. In this case, its range is equal to that of the communications array, and it consumes 1 charge per hour.</p>"

            "value": "<p>A personal comm unit is a pocket-sized device that combines a minor portable computer and a cellular communications device, allowing instantaneous wireless communication with other comm units in both audio- and text-based formats at planetary range. A personal comm unit also includes a calculator, a flashlight (emits bright light in a 5-foot radius around you and dim light in the next 5 feet), a browser that accesses any local infospheres, and several entertainment options (including games).</p>\n<p>Personal comm units integrated into armor have some voice-activated capabilities; you can communicate with other comm units in audio-based formats and receive responses without needing a free hand, but typing a message, browsing the infosphere, or using an app requires the use of at least one hand.</p>\n<p>Comm units that function at longer ranges aren't as portable; they include built-in generators that provide the necessary amount of power and rely on active Drift beacons to communicate. Short-term use of these units can be purchased in most major settlements.</p>"

It can be programmed to project the appearance of another creature of the same size category as yourself, hiding your true appearance. A holoskin doesn't change your voice, scent, or mannerisms. The appearance of held and worn items aren't affected. You usually need a holoskin to set up a disguise in order to @UUID[Compendium.sf2e.actions.Item.Impersonate] someone using the Deception skill. A tactical holoskin adds a +1 item bonus to relevant checks.</p>"

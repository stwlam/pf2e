            "value": "<p>This handheld device is capable of detecting radiation within 120 feet. When you Interact with the device, it emits pings in different tones to indicate the presence of low, medium, high, or severe radiation. It also displays the areas of radiation on a simple screen. It automatically updates the data as you move until the beginning of your next turn. After that, you must Interact with the device again to conduct another sweep. A radiation sweeper can't detect radiation through 3 feet of dirt or wood, 1 foot of stone, 1 inch of common metal, a thin sheet of lead, or any force field. A radiation sweeper is immune to the effects of radiation.</p>"

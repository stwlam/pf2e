Climbing kits allow you to attach yourself to the wall you're Climbing, moving half as quickly as usual (minimum 5 feet) but letting you attempt a @Check[flat|dc:5] whenever you critically fail to prevent a fall. You gain a +1 item bonus to Athletics checks to Climb while using a tactical climbing kit.</p>\n<p>A single kit has only enough materials for one climber; each climber needs their own kit.</p>"

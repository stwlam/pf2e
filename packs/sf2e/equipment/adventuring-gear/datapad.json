            "value": "<p>These ubiquitous handheld computers incorporate a comm unit, microphone, speaker, camera, infosphere browser, and data storage. They can store thousands of hours of recordings, play games, and perform simple computing functions, such as time tracking and notifications, word processing, calculations, data processing, streaming media, and broadcasting emergency alerts from local governments. In most societies, commercial datapads are relatively flimsy, designed to rapidly wear out or fall behind on the latest features and updates to encourage the consumer to replace it with a newer model. In contrast, higher-end datapads are made to last and often include a sturdier chassis and extra functions.</p>"

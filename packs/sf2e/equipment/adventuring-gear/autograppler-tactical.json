Clamps automatically slide from the base of the autograppler along the attached cable, allowing it to be climbed like a knotted rope. You can throw the autograppler to attach it to a solid surface, attempting a ranged attack roll using your simple weapon proficiency against a DC depending on the target, typically at least DC 20. This attack has the secret trait. On a success, your autograppler has a firm hold, but on a critical failure, the grappler seems like it will hold but detaches when you're partway up.</p>\n<p>A tactical autograppler has a sensor to detect whether it has a firm hold, causing it to automatically retract if you critically fail your ranged attack to attach it.</p>"

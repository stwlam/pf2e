Unlike a dedicated grenade launcher, it takes 10 minutes to load an undermounted grenade launcher, reassembling the grenade into ammunition by mounting it on a specialized reusable firing cap. Once a grenade has been loaded, it can only be safely removed by disassembling the entire grenade, destroying it in the process.</p>\n<p>This grenade launcher has a range of 50 feet and the tracking +3 trait.</p>\n<p><strong>Activate—Launch</strong> <span class=\"action-glyph\">1</span> (attack)</p><hr /><p><strong>Effect</strong> You launch the loaded grenade.</p>"

You can securely attach a single piece of tech gear of up to 1 Bulk to a uniclamp when you install the upgrade. You can activate the attached item using the same number of hands you use to wield your weapon while still wielding your weapon. The uniclamp can be properly configured to handle only non-magical tech gear and doesn't function with weapons or shields. The GM might determine that some items don't fit on certain weapons.</p>"

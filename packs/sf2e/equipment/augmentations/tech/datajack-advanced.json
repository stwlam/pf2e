Any handheld computer can connect to the port, while larger systems typically require an adapter cable. You don't need an interface to access the system, as it connects directly to your nervous system via the datajack. You must still attempt any skill checks associated with operating the device, such as Computers to access a system. Some closed systems don't allow direct data access at all.</p>\n<p>You gain a +2 item bonus to Computers checks when accessing a system with an advanced datajack.</p>"

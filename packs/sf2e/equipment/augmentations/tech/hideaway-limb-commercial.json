A hideaway in a leg (in a human) can typically hold more than one in an arm, and your size also adjusts the capacity at the GM's discretion.</p>\n<p>When the compartment is closed, the seam in your limb is difficult to detect. You gain a +1 item bonus to Stealth checks to Conceal an Object in a hideaway limb. Though this compartment can foil a cursory pat down, many security checkpoints include a scan to detect such devices.</p>\n<p><strong>Activate—Draw</strong> <span class=\"action-glyph\">1</span> (manipulate)</p><hr /><p><strong>Effect</strong> You Interact to draw an item @UUID[Compendium.sf2e.conditions.Item.Concealed] in your hideaway limb.</p>"

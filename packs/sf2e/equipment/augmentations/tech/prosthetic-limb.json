Prosthetic limbs are common augmentations available at UPB printing kiosks on many worlds and come in many different materials and sizes. The augmentation restores functionality, including the ability to install other augmentations in the limb, but it's no more durable than and doesn't otherwise function differently from the replaced limb. A prosthetic limb can replace one you've lost, or you can have a limb removed to replace it with a prosthetic. This augmentation doesn't count toward your implant limit.</p>"

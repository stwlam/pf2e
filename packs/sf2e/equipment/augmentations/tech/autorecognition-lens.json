After you've learned someone's name and appearance, a tiny HUD displays their name to you whenever you're looking at them as long as you're aware of their presence and their appearance hasn't dramatically changed (at the GM's discretion). This doesn't help you see or identify people who are trying to hide or disguise their appearance. This augmentation doesn't count toward your implant limit.</p>"

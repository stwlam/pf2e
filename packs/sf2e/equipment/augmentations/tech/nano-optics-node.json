You can see through most materials and walls within 60 feet. Your sight is blocked by 2 feet of wood or plastic, 1 foot of stone, 2 inches of common metal, or any amount of lead or any starmetal, and you can only see in black and white. Due to the distracting amount of visual information, you take a –2 circumstance penalty to Perception checks while the overlay is active.</p>"

You can stow an <em>aeon stone</em> with an Interact action, and an orbiting stone can be snatched out of the air with a successful @UUID[Compendium.sf2e.actions.Item.Disarm] action against you. A stowed or removed stone remains invested, but its effects are @UUID[Compendium.sf2e.conditions.Item.Suppressed]{Suppressed} until you return it to orbit your head again.</p>\n<p>There are various types of <em>aeon stones</em>, each with a different appearance and magical effect. Each <em>aeon stone</em> also gains a resonant power when slotted into specific items, such as weapons with the aeon trait or antique magical devices called <em>wayfinders</em>.</p><hr /><p>This gold star glitters with joyful energy.

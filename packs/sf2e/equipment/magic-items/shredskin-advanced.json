Your disguise affects your visual appearance, sound, scent, and all other forms of detection, including lifesense. After the normal duration of this ability ends, you can extend it by 1 more hour by piercing yourself with hooks on the robe, causing you to lose @Damage[50[healing]] Hit Points. The duration can't be extended a second time, and if these Hit Points are healed, the effect ends immediately.</p>"

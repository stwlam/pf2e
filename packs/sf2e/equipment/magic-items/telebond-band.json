            "value": "<p>This subtle silvery band allows for long distance telepathic communication and was popular on worlds before the widespread adoption of mobile telecommunication technology. The wearer of a <em>telebond band</em> can telepathically communicate with any other creatures wearing a paired <em>telebond band</em> within a planetary range, even if the creatures do not share a language. This doesn't let two characters understand codes, language couched in metaphor, and the like (subject to GM discretion). Pairing or unpairing two or more <em>telebond bands</em> requires looping the two <em>telebond bands</em> together for 1 minute. Up to six <em>telebond bands</em> can be in a paired group with one another; attempting to pair a seventh <em>telebond band</em> fails.</p>\n<p><strong>Activate—Fact Check</strong> <span class=\"action-glyph\">r</span> (concentrate)</p>\n<p><strong>Frequency</strong> once per day</p>\n<p><strong>Trigger</strong> You received information from a @UUID[Compendium.sf2e.actions.Item.Recall Knowledge] check</p><hr /><p><strong>Effect</strong> With a thought, you instantly share the knowledge you learned with the required Recall Knowledge check (even if you learned false information) with any other creature wearing a <em>telebond band</em> that's paired with yours, as long as they're within planetary range. Each creature who has not used Fact Check today can use a reaction to Recall Knowledge and Fact Check.</p>"

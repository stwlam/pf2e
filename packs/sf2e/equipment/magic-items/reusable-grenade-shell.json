You can throw the shell to explode the installed grenade, using the grenade's range, damage, and other effects. The shell remains and repairs the grenade over the course of 24 hours, during which time you can't install another grenade. The shell is too large for a grenade launcher.</p>\n<p><strong>Activate—Install Grenade</strong> <span class=\"action-glyph\">1</span> (manipulate) You install a commercial, tactical, or advanced grenade in the shell.

Casting a spell from a spell gem requires holding the gem in one hand and activating it with a Cast a Spell activity using the normal number of actions for that spell. The spell must appear on your spell list. Because you're the one Casting the Spell, use your spell attack modifier and spell DC. The spell must be of your spellcasting tradition. The spell in a spell gem can be cast only once, and the spell gem is destroyed as part of the casting. Spell gems can't contain cantrips or rituals. The traits for this item vary based on the spell it contains.</p>\n<p><strong>Activate</strong> Cast a Spell</p>\n<p><strong>Effect</strong> You Cast the Spell at the indicated rank.</p>"

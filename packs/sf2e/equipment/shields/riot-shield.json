            "value": "<p>Riot shields are constructed from sheets of transparent aluminum reinforced with nanocarbon panels layered over polymers or resins. These sleek but sturdy shields are designed to protect most of the wielder's body when raised while allowing them to march in tight tactical formations. Sometimes they're transparent to allow inexperienced wielders to see the other side while the shield is raised, but most experienced warriors have no problem seeing around these shields, and the transparent material quickly becomes too scuffed to see through after a few hits.</p>"

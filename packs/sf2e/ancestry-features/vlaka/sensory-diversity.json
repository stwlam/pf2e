The GM might double the range if you're downwind from the creature or halve the range if you're upwind.</p>\n<p>In addition, each vlaka is born with one of the following sensory arrays: blind, deaf, deafblind, or hearing/sighted. Select one of these sensory arrays, and gain the associated senses or feats.</p>\n<p><strong>Blind:</strong> You're blind. You gain hearing as a precise sense with a range of 90 feet.</p>\n<p><strong>Deaf:</strong> You're deaf. You gain the Read Lips skill feat (even if you don't meet the feat's prerequisites).</p>\n<p><strong>Deafblind:</strong> You're blind and deaf. Your scent becomes a precise sense with a range of 90 feet, rather than an imprecise sense with a range of 60 feet. Hearing/Sighted: You don't gain any additional senses.</p>"

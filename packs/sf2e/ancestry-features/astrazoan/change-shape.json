This shape might resemble a specific individual or be completely unique to you. Using Change Shape counts as creating a disguise for the Impersonate use of Deception. You can remain in this shape indefinitely, and you can shift back to your true astrazoan form or another shape by using this action again. If you die while using an alternate shape, your body slowly shifts back to its natural form.</p>"

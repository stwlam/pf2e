Forming this bond is a one-hour activity that can only be attempted if both you and your partner share a deep emotional bond. You and your partner must remain within reach of each other for the duration of this activity for it to succeed. Once this bond is formed, you can't form another partner bond unless your current partner dies. You and your partner can communicate with each other mentally, as if you had limited telepathy with a range of 60 feet.</p>"

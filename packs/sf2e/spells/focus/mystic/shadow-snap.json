This attack uses and contributes to your multiple attack penalty.</p>\n<p>If you stalk, attempt a spell attack roll against the target's AC the first time the target uses a manipulate action or a move action, makes a ranged attack, or leaves a square during a move action it's using until the end of your next turn; dealing 1d10 cold damage on a hit.

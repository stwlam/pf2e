The walls of the cottage are simple and metal, with small, metal shuttered windows, and it has one metal door. It doesn't include its own lock, but it has a fastener to which a lock can be applied.</p>\n<p>The interior contains three cots, one toilet, and a small stove powered by magic. The interior is lit with a small magical light that you can light or extinguish at will using a Sustain action. The climate inside the shack is comfortable and allows creatures inside it to withstand most hostile weather conditions, but incredible heat or cold, powerful storms, and winds of hurricane force or greater destroy the cottage. Other creatures can freely enter and exit the shack without damaging it, but if you exit the shack, the spell ends. You can Dismiss the spell.</p>"

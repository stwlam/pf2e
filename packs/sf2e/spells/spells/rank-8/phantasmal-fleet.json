On a critical failure, the target also believes it's being pursued and moves to take cover. It must spend an action to @UUID[Compendium.sf2e.actions.Item.Take Cover] on each of its turns, which may require it to first move to a new space or Drop Prone. It can attempt a new Will save at the end of each of its turns, and on a success, it disbelieves the phantasm and stops being forced to Take Cover.</p>"

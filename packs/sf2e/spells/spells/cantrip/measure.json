For example, you can't determine the thickness or weight of a wall you can observe only one side of, or the depth of water that extends beyond the spell's range. Each time you Sustain the spell, you learn the exact measurements of one creature or object in the area, including imprecisions or anomalies that might indicate structural weakness.

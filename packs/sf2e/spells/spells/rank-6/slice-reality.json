A creature that succeeds at this save when the chasm is created is pushed to the nearest space on the side of its choice. Creatures trying to move through the chasm fail to do so if they critically fail the save, ending their movement next to the chasm.</p><hr /><p><strong>Heightened (+1)</strong> The damage increases by 1d8.</p>"

While immobilized in this way, it must hold its breath or begin suffocating. The first time each round you Sustain the spell, the target takes 1d12 bludgeoning damage, remains immobilized, and must continue holding its breath. The target can attempt to @UUID[Compendium.sf2e.actions.Item.Escape] (the Escape DC is your spell DC, and the attempt is affected by the incapacitation trait).</p>"

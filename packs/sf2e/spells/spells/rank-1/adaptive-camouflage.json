You become undetected to all creatures that rely on visual senses unless they can see @UUID[Compendium.sf2e.conditions.Item.Invisible] creatures. You Step. If you have cover, greater cover, or concealment, attempt a Stealth check to Hide. The invisibility then ends, and you either become observed or @UUID[Compendium.sf2e.conditions.Item.Hidden] to creatures as determined by your check to Hide, if you made one. If you remain in the area of the trigger, you gain a +2 status bonus to this Stealth check. If you are no longer in the area of the trigger, you gain a +2 status bonus to your Reflex save (if any) against the triggering effect.</p>"

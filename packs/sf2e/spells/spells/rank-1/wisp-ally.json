A wisp doesn't take up space, grant flanking, or have any other attributes a creature would. The wisp generates bright light in a 10-foot radius. When you Cast the Spell and each time you Sustain the spell, your wisp attempts to distract your target, which must succeed at a Will save or become @UUID[Compendium.sf2e.conditions.Item.Off-Guard] until the start of your next turn. A creature who critically succeeds becomes immune to wisp ally for 1 hour.</p><hr /><p><strong>Heightened (+1)</strong> You create one additional wisp, allowing you to choose a different target. Each wisp you create must have a different target, and all of them attempt to distract their targets at the same time when you cast or Sustain this spell.</p>"

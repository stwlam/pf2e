Calculate the persistent damage after all creatures attempt their saves.</p><hr /><p><strong>Critical Success</strong> The target is unaffected.</p>\n<p><strong>Success</strong> The target takes half damage and no persistent mental damage.</p>\n<p><strong>Failure</strong> The target takes full damage, persistent mental damage, and is compelled to howl as long as it takes persistent mental damage.</p>\n<p><strong>Critical Failure</strong> As failure, but the target takes double the initial and persistent damage.</p>"

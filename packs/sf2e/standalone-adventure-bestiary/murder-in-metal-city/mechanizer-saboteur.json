Most specialize in hacking and infiltration. They can disable a machine with a thought, but their appearance often fools organics into not perceiving them as a danger.</p>\n<p>Nobody really knows what the Mechanizers' goals are. They claim to be ushering in the Singularity, which they believe will come from their wireless network of the same name. Yet their actions baffle observers. Most notorious among these are their (thankfully rare) ritualistic mutilation sprees. More common (and less newsworthy) activities also include performance art, \"free upgrades\" at cybernetic augmentation clinics, and university seminars.</p>\n<p>Mechanizer personalities are backed up to the Singularity network, which they believe will be the blueprint for future universal oneness. If a Mechanizer dies, the Singularity generates a new shell for them using recycled parts in one week—perhaps less, if the Mechanizer was in good standing or involved in an important operation.</p><h2>Mechanizer Treasure</h2><p>The weapons integrated into Mechanizers' bodies can be removed from a corpse by a character who succeeds at a @Check[crafting|dc:12] or @Check[medicine|dc:12] check, who must also attempt a @Check[fortitude|dc:12] save, becoming @UUID[Compendium.sf2e.conditions.Item.Sickened]{Sickened 1} for 1 minute on a failure.

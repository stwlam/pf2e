Insight Array rapidly dispatches them, typically in groups that are squares of 2 (such as 2, 4, 8, 16, or more), to any scene of trouble throughout the city. Anacite protectors also act as sentries, escorts, or private security, though anyone who uses them for the latter should be aware that most anacite protectors in Striving serve the needs of Insight Array (and anacites as a whole) above all else.</p><hr /><p>Recording the countless forms and upgrades anacites have taken in the long period since their creators abandoned them would be impossible, as nearly every shape and function one might imagine can be found among this industrious species.</p>\n<p>Many anacites share common design principles, such as silvery, metallic bodies, multiple legs, and forms that resemble arthropods. They often have grasping claws to accomplish generic tasks, though some might have limbs or appendages suited to extremely specific purposes. The most basic anacites, such as wingbots, who lack minds of their own, are the most likely to look \"standardized,\" but most anacites are unique. Their specific role might dictate that an anacite must be able to lift heavy loads, in which case the anacite might resemble a forklift more than a bug or perhaps have the features of both. Anacite culture prizes innovation, and most anacites view their bodies and programming as no exception, always willing to try new parts and builds or download skill modules to broaden their horizons.</p>\n<p>The other types of anacites most often found in Striving include bulky laborers, spindly bureaucrats, and civil servants of all types. In neighborhoods that cater mostly to off-worlders and organics, some anacites have specialized roles to make the area more appealing to non-anacite life. Such anacites might receive assignments from Insight Array to \"visit every club and eatery in the area,\" \"chat with strangers in public spaces,\" or \"routinely ask tourists for help crossing the street.\" These chosen anacites take these roles as seriously as any other.</p><h2>Anacite Augmentations</h2><p>Almost all anacites augment their bodies in some way, either to directly enhance their ability to perform their specific function in society or to set them apart from other anacites with a unique feature. On Aballon, such augmentations are easy to come by, and if the anacite can prove the augmentation will contribute to their society, they're often completely free. Some anacites take advantage of this availability to swap their augmentations on a regular basis.</p><h2>Anacite Programming</h2><p>Because they're robots, anacites are programmed for specialized tasks and abilities, but each has free will and a complex inner life. Every anacite also has a purpose assigned at manufacture, which most take very seriously. In their lifetime, an anacite is likely to pursue different types of work as determined by Insight Array. Following programming and serving the algorithm are edicts for almost all anacites. Following these edicts brings fulfillment and pleasure, while anacites who go against their programming may feel guilt or even physical discomfort,</p>",

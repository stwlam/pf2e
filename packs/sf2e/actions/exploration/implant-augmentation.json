This takes 1 hour per item level of the augmentation if using a medkit or half the normal amount of time if you have access to a hospital or medical facility. Most shops that sell augmentations have staff willing to perform the surgery as part of the cost and are experienced enough that they can perform the surgery in 10 minutes per item level instead of 1 hour per item level. This activity can be performed in downtime mode, in which case it loses the exploration trait and gains the downtime trait.</p>"

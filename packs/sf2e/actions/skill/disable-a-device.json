You leave no trace of your tampering, and you can rearm the device later, if that type of device can be rearmed.</p>\n<p><strong>Success</strong> You disable the device, or you achieve one success toward disabling a device that requires more than one success.</p>\n<p><strong>Critical Failure</strong> You trigger the device.</p>"

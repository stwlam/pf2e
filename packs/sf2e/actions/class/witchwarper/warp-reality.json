Your quantum field is a @Template[type:burst|distance:20] centered on a point you choose within 100 feet. While your quantum field is active, you can use actions that have the anchoring trait. Your quantum field's other specific effects are determined by your paradox. Choose whether any given creature in the area is affected by your quantum field when you Warp Reality, each time you Sustain it, and when a creature enters your quantum field. Each time you Sustain a quantum field with the Sustain action (instead of an anchoring action), you can move it to a new position within 100 feet.</p>\n<p>Your quantum field automatically deactivates if you're knocked out, if you Dismiss it, or if you move more than 100 feet away from it.</p>"

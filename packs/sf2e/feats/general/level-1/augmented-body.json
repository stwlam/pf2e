The first time you take this feat, the augmentation you receive is free as long as its item level is 1 or lower. You can upgrade this augmentation by swapping it out with another augmentation when you gain a level or by spending downtime replacing the augmentation as though changing out a feat. When you swap out the augmentation, you must pay the difference between the original and new augmentation each time you upgrade.</p><hr /><p><strong>Special</strong> You can select this feat multiple times, choosing a different augmentation each time. Retraining this feat requires paying the cost of the original augmentation.</p>"

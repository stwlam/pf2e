While such talismans are traditionally scraps of paper with a religious symbol drawn on them, they can take many forms, including body art, a sticker, or even a virtual emoji. You can create a talisman only for yourself and for the deity you worship. As long as you continue to engage in activities that match your deity's edicts you gain a +1 status bonus to initiative rolls. If you violate your deity's anathema, the talisman is destroyed, and you take a –1 status penalty to initiative rolls and Perception checks until you complete an @UUID[Compendium.sf2e.spells.Item.Atone] ritual.</p>"

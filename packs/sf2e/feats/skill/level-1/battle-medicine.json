As with Treat Wounds, you can attempt checks against higher DCs if you have the minimum proficiency rank. The target is then @UUID[Compendium.sf2e.feat-effects.Item.Effect: Battle Medicine Immunity]{immune} to your Battle Medicine for 1 day. This does not make them immune to, or otherwise count as, Treat Wounds.</p>"

When calculating your travel Speed for the day while piloting a vehicle, you can attempt a Piloting check to increase your vehicle's travel Speed for long-term overland or aerial travel. The DC is determined by the GM but is typically based on the vehicle's piloting DC or a difficulty based on the environment, whichever is harder. On a success, double your vehicle's travel Speed for the day. This has no effect on your vehicle's movement in encounters or on starships traveling through the Drift.</p>"

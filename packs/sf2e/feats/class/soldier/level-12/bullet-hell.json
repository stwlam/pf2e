Make an @UUID[Compendium.sf2e.actions.Item.Area Fire] or @UUID[Compendium.sf2e.actions.Item.Auto-Fire] attack with your weapon. Until the start of your next turn, any creature that moves through the area you attacked takes 1d4 damage of the same type as the weapon fired per square traversed, with a @Check[reflex|against:soldier|basic|options:area-effect] save at the end of each move action it takes through the area. On a failure, a creature becomes @UUID[Compendium.sf2e.conditions.Item.Suppressed] until the start of your next turn.</p>"

You make an Area Fire and then @UUID[Compendium.sf2e.actions.Item.Leap], using your weapon to add a status bonus to the distance traveled equal to double the burst of your weapon. You must be somewhere within the area of the weapon's area attack, but you don't have to save against the effect of your attack.</p>\n<p>Movement made as part of this action doesn't trigger reactions, though Area Fire still triggers them normally.</p>"

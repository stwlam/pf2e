The ally gains all the benefits of your quantum field, and your warp spells originate from your ally instead of you until your quantum field deactivates. If you cast warp spells at other targets, you must still have line of sight to the target, but the spell originates from your ally for purposes of determining its range and line of effect.</p>"

When you use the Sustain action to move your quantum field, you can teleport any number of creatures within the quantum field's original area to squares of your choice in its new area. You also teleport any items they're wearing or holding. This gives the Sustain action the teleportation trait. Each target can attempt a @Check[will|against:witchwarper|options:area-effect] save against your class DC. Targets who succeed at the save are unaffected.</p>"

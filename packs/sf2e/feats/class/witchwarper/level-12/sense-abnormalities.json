You can sense the presence of magic auras as though you were always using a 1st-rank @UUID[Compendium.sf2e.spells.Item.Detect Magic] spell. This detects magic in your field of vision only. When you @UUID[Compendium.sf2e.actions.Item.Seek], you gain the benefits of a 3rd-rank <em>detect magic</em> spell on things you see (in addition to the normal benefits of Seeking). You can turn this sense off and on with a free action at the start or the end of your turn.</p>"

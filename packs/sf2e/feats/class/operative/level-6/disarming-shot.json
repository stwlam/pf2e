If the Strike hits, attempt to @UUID[Compendium.sf2e.actions.Item.Disarm] the target using the same ranged attack roll against the target's Reflex DC, instead of attempting an Athletics check. A Disarming Shot counts as two attacks for your multiple attack penalty, but the penalty doesn't increase until after you've used Disarming Shot.</p>"

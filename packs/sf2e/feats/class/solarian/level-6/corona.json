While photon-attuned, your Corona has the light trait.</p>\n<p><strong>Graviton-Attuned</strong> Your Corona is darkness that prevents light from penetrating the area. This acts as a @UUID[Compendium.sf2e.spells.Item.Darkness] spell with a spell rank equal to half your level.</p>\n<p><strong>Photon-Attuned</strong> Your Corona is solar light that sheds bright light in the area (and dim light for the next 20 feet).

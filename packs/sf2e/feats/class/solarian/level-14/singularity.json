You concentrate and manifest the pinpoint center of a black hole within 60 feet. This occupies a single 5-foot space. Creatures within the singularity's space take @Damage[(max((2*floor(@actor.level / 2) - 4),10))d8[void]|options:area-damage] damage with a @Check[reflex|against:solarian|basic|options:area-effect] save against your class DC. Any creature dropped to 0 Hit Points by this effect is torn asunder and pulled into the singularity, leaving no remains. Until the end of your next turn, light can't pass through the singularity's space and all adjacent squares, shrouding it in darkness that even creatures with darkvision or greater darkvision can't see through. Any creature that starts its turn in the darkness must succeed at a @Check[fortitude|against:solarian|basic|options:area-effect,inflicts:slowed] save against your class DC or become @UUID[Compendium.sf2e.conditions.Item.Slowed]{Slowed 1} for that turn.</p><hr /><p><strong>Level (+2)</strong> Increase the damage by 2d8.</p>"

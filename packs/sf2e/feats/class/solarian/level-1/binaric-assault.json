Make two Strikes at the same target, one with your solar weapon and one with your solar flare, each using your current multiple attack penalty. You can make these Strikes in whichever order you desire. After the first time a Strike hits, resolve the damage and effects, then swap your current attunement. If both attacks fail to hit, you become unattuned. Binaric Assault counts as two attacks when calculating your multiple attack penalty.</p>"

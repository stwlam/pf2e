Step twice.</p>\n<p><strong>Graviton-Attuned</strong> You move 10 feet with each Step, rather than 5 feet.</p>\n<p><strong>Photon-Attuned</strong> You leave an afterimage in the square you started in. This image lasts until the end of your next turn but ends early if another creature enters the space. This afterimage counts as an ally to you and your allies for the purposes of flanking.</p>"

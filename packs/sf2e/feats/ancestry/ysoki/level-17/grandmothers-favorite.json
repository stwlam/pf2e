Additionally, once per month, whenever you would die, your body instead transforms into a swarm of dispersing rats. After [[/gmr 1d6 #days]]{1d6 days}, these rats gather in a safe space of the GM's choosing (a site dedicated to Lao Shu Po, if possible) and reform your body. You're returned to life at your maximum Hit Points.</p>"

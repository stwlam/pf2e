You can use the Crafting skill rather than Deception to Impersonate another person, and can do so in 1 minute rather than the usual 10 minutes. You don't need a disguise kit to Impersonate a specific person when using Crafting to do so, and a maker's toolkit grants a +1 item bonus to the check.</p>"

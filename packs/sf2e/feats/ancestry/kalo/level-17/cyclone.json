You spin in place and can attempt an @Check[athletics|against:fortitude] check against the Fortitude DC of all creatures within 20 feet of you (or 40 feet if you and the target are in water). On a success, that creature is moved adjacent to you. On a critical success, it's also knocked @UUID[Compendium.sf2e.conditions.Item.Prone]. If a creature is within melee reach of you after this check is resolved, you can Strike that creature.</p>"

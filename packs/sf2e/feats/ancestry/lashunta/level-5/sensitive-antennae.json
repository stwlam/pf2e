This means you can use your antennae to determine if a creature is within range. Your thoughtsense detects only thinking creatures, so a creature that's unthinking or otherwise immune to mental effects can't be perceived using your thoughtsense. This doesn't give you the ability to read or understand their thoughts.</p>\n<p>At 9th level, this becomes an imprecise sense.</p>"

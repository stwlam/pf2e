With a thought, you seize a fragment of the Drift and temporarily transplant it onto the battlefield as an intangible barrier of colorful light. This shimmering field appears within 30 feet and is straight and vertical, stretching up to 10 feet long and 10 feet high. The barrier grants concealment to creatures targeted through it, and it sheds colorful bright light for 10 feet on each side and dim light for the next 10 feet. You can ignore any concealment granted by the barrier. The barrier lasts for 5 rounds.</p>"

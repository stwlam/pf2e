You gain electromagnetic sense as an imprecise sense out to 15 feet. Electromagnetic sense allows you to detect nearby living and technological creatures, but you might have to use the @UUID[Compendium.sf2e.actions.Item.Seek] action to find an undetected creature in an environment with too much electromagnetic radiation, such as inside the engine room of a spaceship or near a powerful source of radio waves.</p>"

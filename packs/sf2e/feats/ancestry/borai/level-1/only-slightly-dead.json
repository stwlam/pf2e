You don't have to attempt Deception checks against a creature's Perception DC to successfully Impersonate yourself as a living member of your ancestry or hide your borai heritage, nor do you require a disguise kit for such Impersonations. This is a non-magical effect that doesn't protect against detection, revelation, or scrying effects. Additionally, when a creature actively attempts a Perception check against you, you gain a +4 circumstance bonus to your Deception DC, but only for the purposes of seeing through your disguise when you're Impersonating yourself as a living member of your ancestry or otherwise attempting to hide your borai heritage.</p>"

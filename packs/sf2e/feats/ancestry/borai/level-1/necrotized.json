This experimentation has strengthened your defenses against death but has also made you look more like a corpse than a living being. You gain the Diehard feat, and death effects no longer kill you if they reduce you to 0 Hit Points. This keeps you from being automatically killed or from having your dying value automatically decrease, but it doesn't make you immune to other parts of the spell or effect. For example, you can still take mental damage and become frightened by a vision of death spell, you just don't instantly die from it.</p>"

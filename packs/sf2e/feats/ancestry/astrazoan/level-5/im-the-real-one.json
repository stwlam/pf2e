All other creatures must use the @UUID[Compendium.sf2e.actions.Item.Seek] action to attempt a Perception check against your Deception DC to determine which creature is real and which is an imitation. A creature who doesn't know which creature you are must succeed at a @Check[flat|dc:11] when targeting either of you with an attack, spell, or other effect. If the check fails, the attack, spell, or effect targets the other creature instead.</p>\n<p>Abilities such as telepathy or the mystic's group chat feature may automatically allow a creature to determine which creature is which, but an aware creature must still use the @UUID[Compendium.sf2e.actions.Item.Point Out] action to indicate to others which creature is which. An imitated creature might have a signal or phrase that indicates to their allies which creature is which, but doing so in the din of battle is an action with the auditory or visual trait.</p>"

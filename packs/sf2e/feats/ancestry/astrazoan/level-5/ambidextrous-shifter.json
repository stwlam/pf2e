You have six arms, which allows you to wield and hold up to six hands' worth of weapons and equipment. If you use more than four of these arms, your land Speed becomes 5 feet. At any time, one pair of hands is designated your active hands. You can change this designation from one pair of hands to another by taking the @UUID[Compendium.sf2e.actions.Item.Switch Hands] action, which is a single action. You can only perform actions with your active hands. This feat allows you to use up to six arms when you use Change Shape to take a form with multiple arms, such as a kasatha or skittermander.</p>"

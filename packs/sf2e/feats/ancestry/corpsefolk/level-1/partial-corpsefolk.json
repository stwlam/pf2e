There is no hiding your undead nature from onlookers unless you are wholly disguised, but you can manipulate your broken shards in creative ways. Your reduced mass gives you a +5-foot status bonus to your land Speed. In addition, you can spend 1 action that has the manipulate trait to break off a jagged piece of your own body to create a commercial @UUID[Compendium.sf2e.equipment.Item.Knife]. You can create a number of knives at a time equal to your Constitution modifier. They can't be sold and don't function for others. Effects that enhance your natural attacks, such as hardlight handwraps, apply their effects to a commercial knife created in this way while you're wielding it.</p>"

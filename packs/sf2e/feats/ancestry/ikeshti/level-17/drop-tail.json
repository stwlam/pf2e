Your tail falls off and flails around wildly, distracting your foes. You Stride up to your Speed, and don't trigger reactions due to this movement. Your tail grows back over 24 hours. While your tail is regrowing, you don't have a tail, your Speed is reduced by 5 feet, and you take a –2 status penalty to Acrobatics checks.</p>"

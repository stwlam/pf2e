You are trained in Mission Lore, a special Lore skill that can be used only to @UUID[Compendium.sf2e.actions.Item.Recall Knowledge], but on any topic related to an assignment, mission, or quest performed on behalf of another individual or organization. If you fail a check to Recall Knowledge with Mission Lore, you get the effects of the @UUID[Compendium.sf2e.feats.Item.Dubious Knowledge] skill feat unless the question was already answered during a mission briefing. If you have legendary proficiency in Society, you gain expert proficiency in Mission Lore, but you can't increase your proficiency rank in Mission Lore by any other means.</p>"

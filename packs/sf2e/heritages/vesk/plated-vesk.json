Your scales count as medium armor in the plate armor group. They grant a +3 item bonus to AC, have a Dex cap of +1, a check penalty of –2, and a Strength threshold of +3, and have the comfort and exposed traits. This item bonus increases to +4 at 5th level. You can wear a flight suit, but you can't wear other armor. You can etch armor runes onto your scales, but you can't install armor upgrades.</p>"

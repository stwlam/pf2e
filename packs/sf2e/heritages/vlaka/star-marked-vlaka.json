With a moment's thought, you can cause these star markings to shed bright light in a 40-foot radius (and dim light to the next 40 feet). This light has the light and occult traits. You can spark or extinguish this light using a single action, which has the concentrate trait. You can't activate this ability when you're beyond the energy of a sun or stars, such as in the Drift or on another plane of existence where these celestial bodies don't exist.</p>"

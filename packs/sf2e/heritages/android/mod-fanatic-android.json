You can install and uninstall armor upgrades into your personal upgrade slot using the Install Upgrade activity. Choose one common armor upgrade with an item level of 1 or less. You begin with this armor upgrade already installed in your upgrade slot (you don't need to pay the credits to purchase this starting upgrade).</p>"

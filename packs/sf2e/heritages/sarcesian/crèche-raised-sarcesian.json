You learned how to get along with others and stand out in a crowd early on. You are trained in Diplomacy. If you would automatically become trained in Diplomacy (from your background or class, for example), you instead become trained in a skill of your choice. You gain the @UUID[Compendium.sf2e.feats.Item.Group Impression] skill feat.</p>"

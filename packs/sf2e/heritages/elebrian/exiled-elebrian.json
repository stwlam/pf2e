Maybe you come from a tiny enclave of elebrians making their home away from Eox, a tight-knit community on Absalom Station, or an asteroid in the Diaspora. You learn any regional language of your choice and gain the @UUID[Compendium.sf2e.feats.Item.Additional Lore] general feat for that region. You learn another regional language and gain the Additional Lore general feat for that region at 5th level, and again at 13th level.</p>"

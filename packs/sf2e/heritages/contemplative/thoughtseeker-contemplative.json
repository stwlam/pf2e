You are descended from these psychic explorers or trained extensively with their successors. You gain @UUID[Compendium.sf2e.spells.Item.Detect Thoughts] as an occult innate cantrip, which you can cast at will. A cantrip is heightened to a spell rank equal to half your level, rounded up. In addition, increase the range of your thoughtsense by 10 feet.</p>"

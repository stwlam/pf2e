You might be the descendant of ancient pahtras who dwelled in the frigid regions of Pulonis long before the Veskarium's exploitation changed its climate, or you might have unlocked this genetic potential through bioengineering. You gain cold resistance equal to half your level (minimum 1). You treat environmental cold effects as if they were one step less extreme (incredible cold becomes extreme, extreme cold becomes severe, and so on).</p>"

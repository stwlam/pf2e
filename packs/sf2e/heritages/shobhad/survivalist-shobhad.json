As an inheritor of these skills, you are exceptionally talented at seeing to your own subsistence and even that of others while still performing other critical tasks. You can perform the @UUID[Compendium.sf2e.actions.Item.Scout] exploration activity at the same time as the @UUID[Compendium.sf2e.actions.Item.Track] exploration activity. During downtime, you can perform the Subsist downtime activity alongside any one other downtime activity you are capable of performing.</p>"

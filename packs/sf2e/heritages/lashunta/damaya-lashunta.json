You might have a leaner, lither body type than other lashuntas and are likely encouraged to pursue work as a scholar or politician. In addition to what you gain from your ancestry, you gain an attribute boost to Intelligence and an attribute flaw to Constitution, but the free ancestry boost can't also be Intelligence. You become trained in Diplomacy. If you would automatically become trained in Diplomacy (from your background or class, for example), you become trained in another skill of your choice. You gain the @UUID[Compendium.sf2e.feats.Item.Additional Lore] general feat.</p>"

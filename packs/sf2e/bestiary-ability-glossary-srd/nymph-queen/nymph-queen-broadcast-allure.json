Alternatively, she can send this image to any comm address or addresses that she knows. Each creature that can see the image must succeed at a Will save against the nymph queen's spell DC or have their attitude toward her improve by one step (two steps on a critical failure). Affected creatures' attitudes revert to their previous level if the nymph queen uses a hostile action against them or their allies.</p>"

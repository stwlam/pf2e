            "value": "<p>A nymph queen can inspire a single intelligent creature by sending them a motivational video or text message. As long as the creature keeps the message saved and remains in good standing with the nymph queen, they gain a +1 status bonus to all Crafting, Performance, and Lore checks related to art or performance. As a 1-action Interact action, the creature can play or view the message to bolster their spirits. Doing so allows the creature to attempt a counteract check against a single emotion effect affecting them, using the nymph queen's spell attack modifier. When the nymph queen's message is used in this way, it becomes a mundane video or text afterward.</p>"

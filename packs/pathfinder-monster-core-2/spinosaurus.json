Often quite colorful, this sail allows the spinosaurus to attract mates, aids in swimming, and makes it appear to be even larger than it actually is. A swimming spinosaurus can also use the sail as part of a unique means of staggering prey by slapping the water with it to make a crushing wave. A spinosaurus can measure up to 60 feet in length and weigh 25,000 pounds.</p>\n<p>The spinosaurus is equally at home in water as it is on land, and its long, toothy maw is well-adapted for catching swimming prey. Attempts by giants to capture spinosauruses to serve as guardians typically go poorly, for these headstrong dinosaurs do not domesticate well. Their surly attitudes and striking appearances make them better suited for blood sports, and they're popular prizes for those who run arenas specializing in battles that pit gladiators against hungry animals or beasts. These productions are truly feasts of gore for the eyes and command audiences from hundreds of miles around. Of course, an angry dinosaur forced to fight for the amusement of others won't discriminate between potential meals on the battleground and those seated in the surrounding stands, making the seats closest to the edge of the arena possibly part of the show as well.</p>\n<p>The spinosaurus's appearance and strength make it attractive to more than just giants and blood sport organizers. Spellcasters who mutate and transform animals into magical guardians have long been intrigued by the spinosaurus's potential. Due to the creature's reputation for violence, these spellcasters face great danger while charming one to bring home. Yet for those intrigued by the creature's hypothetical abilities, such risk is worth it. More so than any other dinosaur, spinosauruses have been subjected to fleshwarping procedures, crossbreeding with monsters, and other magical techniques at the hands of reclusive spellcasters experimenting to enhance the creatures' viability as effective guardians.</p>",

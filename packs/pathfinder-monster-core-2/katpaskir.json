Katpaskirs have an uncanny sense for locating portals and other planar convergences. They seek to corrupt and expand these gateways, setting them loose to expand on their own or drift across the multiverse. As they do, they slowly contribute to the ultimate unraveling of reality. Katpaskirs often appear as insectile humanoids with multiple arms or legs, each capable of scratching and clawing away at the seams of existence.</p>",

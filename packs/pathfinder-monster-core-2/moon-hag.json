Unlike with the @UUID[Compendium.pf2e.spells-srd.Item.Illusory Creature] spell, creatures in your scene lack combat abilities and statistics. Your scene doesn't include changes to the environment around it, though you can place your scene within the illusory environment of a @UUID[Compendium.pf2e.spells-srd.Item.Mirage] spell.</p>\n<p>When you create the scene, you can choose to have it be static or follow a program. Though a static scene is stationary, it includes basic natural movement. For example, wind blowing on an illusory piece of paper would rustle it. A program can be up to 1 minute long and repeats when finished. For instance, you could create a scene of two orcs fighting each other, and the fight would go the same way for each repetition. If you create a loop, the two fighters end up in the same place at the start of the scene and at the end of it, but you can smooth the program so it's hard to tell when the loop ends and begins. Anyone observing the scene for more than a few minutes almost always notices it looping. You're unable to alter the program after you create the illusion.</p>\n<p>Any creature that touches any part of the image or uses the @UUID[Compendium.pf2e.actionspf2e.Item.Seek] action to examine it can attempt to disbelieve your illusion.

Unlike most hags, moon hags typically target the fearful and ambitious, but this is mainly due to such people being easier to manipulate—the fallout from a moon hag's manipulations can destroy families, trigger wars, and ruin nations. A moon hag's true form has chalk white skin, blackened lips, and glowing eyes.</p><hr /><p>Hags are bizarre predators with uncertain origins, best known for targeting children and the young. To a one, they appear female, and they typically disguise themselves as mortal women in their day-to-day lives. Their powerful magic and manipulative tactics allow them to lure in the naive and vulnerable, exploiting their victims for their own sadistic purposes before kidnapping or devouring them. The typical hag is defined by a vain and controlling nature. Less malevolent hags may exist, but if so, they keep themselves well hidden to avoid the attentions of adventurers and their own abusive kin.</p>",

The creature must succeed at a @Check[will|dc:38] save or become @UUID[Compendium.pf2e.conditionitems.Item.Slowed]{Slowed 1} for 1 round as it refects upon its actions (or 1 minute on a critical failure, as the creature's actions continue to weigh on it). A holy creature or a morally upstanding creature (as determined by the GM) uses the outcome that is one degree of success better than it rolled on its save. A creature that fails its save is then temporarily immune to Soul Refection for 1 minute.</p>"

Clad in plate armor that features a brilliantly shining mirror in the chest and bearing spikes and nails impaled into their bodies, ninkondas serve as hunters for celestial forces. Rather than immediately slaying their quarries, however, ninkondas do their best to encourage a change of heart and foster eventual redemption in their targets. Ninkondas use their mirrors to refect the sins of the target and showcase the state of their soul, and many targets seek to change after glimpsing this refection. Those who don't soon fnd themselves facing off against the wordless might of their hunter.</p>",

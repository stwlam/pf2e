Once judged, their soul is sent on to their final reward or punishment and, in the process, transformed into a creature known as a shade. This transformation grants the soul a new body, one whose shape is determined by the prevailing philosophical forces of the plane to which they're sent. A shade's memories from their former life usually fade, reduced to a few hazy fragments akin to half-remembered dreams. Regardless of the shade's size, power, or nature in life, they're a Medium creature in their afterlife.</p>\n<p>Existence as a shade can last for eons but isn't necessarily eternal. Deities, powerful denizens of the Great Beyond, or even the Outer Planes can further alter a shade's nature by either reducing them into raw quintessence, spiritual essence that's then used to expand a plane's physical manifestation, or by transforming them into a new form of supernatural life such as a celestial, monitor, or fiend. Should a shade die, their body breaks down in a process akin to decay, their form reverting to the elements that make up their plane. This represents the true end of a soul's journey—their life essence reuniting with the heart of the Great Beyond to be recycled into Creation's Forge, fueling the creation of new souls.</p>",

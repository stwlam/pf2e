The target must attempt a @Check[will|dc:32] save. On a failure, the target gains a +2 status bonus to saving throws against fear effects but also takes a –2 penalty to all attack rolls and skill checks for 1 hour. During this time, the victim can't benefit from @UUID[Compendium.pf2e.actionspf2e.Item.Aid] reactions, use healing effects on themselves, or use @UUID[Compendium.pf2e.actionspf2e.Item.Take Cover] or Raise a Shield actions, as these actions seem unnecessary to the creature at this time. Similar defensive actions might not be available to the victim as well, at the GM's discretion. The target is then temporarily immune to Vainglorious Whispers for 24 hours.</p>\n<p>@UUID[Compendium.pf2e.bestiary-effects.Item.Effect: Vainglorious Whispers]</p>"

They dip the bodies of mortals they've driven to despair into molten metal to make horrifically malformed statues, which they then add to their lairs.</p>\n<p>Rust devils prefer temptation to fighting and only enter combat if protecting something dear to them.</p>",

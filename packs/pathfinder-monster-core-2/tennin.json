For example, <em>+1 striking handwraps of mighty blows</em> would give you a +1 item bonus to attack rolls with your unarmed attacks and increase the damage of your unarmed attacks from one weapon die to two (normally 2d4 instead of 1d4, but if your fists have a different weapon damage die or you have other unarmed attacks, use two of that die size instead).</p>\n<p>You can upgrade, add, and transfer runes to and from the handwraps just as you would for a weapon, and you can attach talismans to the handwraps. Treat the handwraps as melee weapons of the brawling group with light Bulk for these purposes. Property runes apply only when they would be applicable to the unarmed attack you're using. For example, a property that must be applied to a slashing weapon wouldn't function when you attacked with a fist, but you would gain its benefits if you attacked with a claw or some other slashing unarmed attack.</p>"

The realm of Nirvana often promotes the virtuous souls of dutiful craftspeople and dedicated musicians to the ranks of the brocade angels so they might use their talents to bring beauty and kindness to a Universe overwhelmed by war.</p>\n<p>It feels like there have always been too few tennins to attend to the needs of an entire world. Tragically, their numbers are dwindling in the wake of Gorum's death, which has sparked and renewed numerous conficts. Many angels have fallen or lost their way amid the discord.</p>",

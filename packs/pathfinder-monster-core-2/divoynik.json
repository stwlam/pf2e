A divoynik retains their most recently assumed guise even after death. Spells like ring of truth help see through a divoynik, and truesight reveals its shapeshifted nature, making clear otherwise imperceptible markings similar to an animal's stripes on a divoynik's body. Beyond magic, people who encounter a divoynik can always rely on one other method of identification. Although identical to their mimicked form in all other respects, a divoynik's body contains neither blood nor a heart.</p>",

Like other fey, they enjoy lavish pranks and fantastical illusions that create chicanery and confusion. A larabay's desire for a joke can sometimes reach dire extremes, such as employing illusions to lure ships into rocks and travelers off cliffs. While some have fortuitously become heroes by playing pranks on tyrants or cruel people, this is almost entirely coincidental, as larabays do not often consider the morals or goals of their targets; they simply enjoy the fruits of their chaos.</p>",

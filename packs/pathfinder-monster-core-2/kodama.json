In the Forest of Spirits in Minkai, for example, so many trees are possessed by kodama that a traveler might pass by hundreds, if not thousands, of these beings while journeying through a single acre of woodland.</p>\n<p>Kodama try their utmost to protect their sacred trees, but a single kodama is a minor obstacle to most oni or others who have no qualms about desecrating forests or harvesting them for natural resources. Like trees in a forest, kodama are most powerful in great numbers and among other kami, whom they can bolster with their magical straw ropes while distracting strong enemies with their mesmerizing presence. On the other hand, kodama bear no ill will toward those who respect their wards, even allowing druids and other deferential creatures to dwell within their bounds. They might even subtly guide lost travelers out of the forest or back to safety.</p><hr /><p>Kami are divine nature spirits from the lands of Tian Xia, far to the east of the Inner Sea region. They serve as guardians of natural objects and places they protect—their wards—and are ancient enemies of oni (Pathfinder Monster Core 252–255). Kami can merge with their wards, allowing them to surreptitiously watch anyone who treads upon their sacred grounds. Kami leave those who they deem harmless alone, but fight vigilantly to scare away anyone perceived as a threat.</p>",

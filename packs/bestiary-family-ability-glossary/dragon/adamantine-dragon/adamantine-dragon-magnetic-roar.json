Any unattended metal object of 1 Bulk or less flies to the dragon and sticks to their hide, granting a +2 item bonus to AC for 1 minute. Any creature holding a metal object of 1 Bulk or less must attempt at a @Check[fortitude|dc:] save with a DC equal to the dragon's Avalanche Breath DC or have their item pulled to the dragon and stuck for 1 round. A creature wearing metal armor instead must succeed at a @Check[fortitude|dc:] save against the DC + 2 or be pulled, taking @Damage[1d6[bludgeoning]] damage for every 10 feet it was moved, and become magnetically stuck to the dragon for 1 round. An object or creature can be unstuck with an Interact action.</p>"

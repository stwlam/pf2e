If the dragon creates a mindless undead creature whose level is at least 2 lower than themself, it automatically becomes the dragon's minion—a deathless servant. This minion can't be destroyed unless the dragon is slain; if reduced to 0 Hit Points, such a minion returns to full Hit Points [[/gmr 1d6 #days]]{1d6 days} later. A resurrection dragon can have only one deathless servant at a time.</p>"

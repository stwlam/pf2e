Every creature in the area that is fully or partially submerged in water must succeed at a @Check[reflex|basic|dc:|options:area-effect] saving throw (DC equal to the DC of the dragon's Hydraulic Breath) or take piercing damage equal to half that dealt by their Hydraulic Breath and an equivalent amount of poison damage. The dragon can specify any number of creatures within the area to be spared. All summoned creatures disperse at the end of the dragon's turn.</p>"

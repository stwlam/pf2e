The dragon creates a runic jail in a @Template[type:burst|distance:10] up to 60 feet away. The area is difficult terrain and creatures outside the jail become @UUID[Compendium.pf2e.conditionitems.Item.Concealed] to creatures within it. If a creature uses a move action to leave the runic jail, they gain a detonating rune. The runic jail lasts for 1 round, but a creature adjacent to the jail, but not within it, can use an Interact action to remove the rune early.</p>"

Your natural physical aging ceases and you gain the Draconic Vitality action, but your soul grows withered and scabrous by the weight of a dragon's experience with time.</p>\n<p>Once per week, from any distance, the dragon can use a free action, which has the concentrate trait, to become @UUID[Compendium.pf2e.conditionitems.Item.Quickened] for 1 minute. They can use the extra action to Stride, Strike, or to contribute an action to casting a spell. When the dragon uses this ability, you age 10 years and become @UUID[Compendium.pf2e.conditionitems.Item.Drained]{Drained 3} for 1 hour.</p>\n<p><strong>Draconic Vitality</strong> <span class=\"action-glyph\">1</span> (concentrate)</p>\n<p><strong>Frequency</strong> once per day</p><hr /><p><strong>Effect</strong> Reduce your doomed value by 2. For 1 hour, you gain a +2 status bonus to saves against poisons and diseases, and a status bonus equal to your level to Hit Points you regain from spells with the same tradition as your bound dragon.</p><hr /><p><strong>Oathbreaker's Calamity</strong> Should either party break the oath, you begin aging at an accelerated rate. Every [[/gmr 1d6 #days]]{1d6 days}, you must succeed at a flat DC 14 check or age 10 years and become @UUID[Compendium.pf2e.conditionitems.Item.Drained]{Drained 3}. In turn, the dragon loses years of experience, reducing its age 100 years every time you fail the flat check. If the dragon is de-aged past the time they made the pact, the pact remains, but the dragon loses all memories of you and the pact.</p>"

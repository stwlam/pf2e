When an activated juxtaposition ammunition hits a creature, it doesn't deal the Strike's normal damage. Instead, the target must succeed at a @Check[will|dc:28|name:Prevent Teleportation|traits:teleportation|showDC:all] save or be teleported to a safe, unoccupied square of your choice within 60 feet of its original position and within the weapon's first range increment. On a critical failure, the target is also @UUID[Compendium.pf2e.conditionitems.Item.Sickened]{Sickened 1} from the gut-wrenching sensation of sudden movement. Any relocation from the juxtaposition ammunition is forced movement.</p>"

The wall is 1 inch thick, 25 feet long, and 10 feet high. The barrier is conjured adjacent to you in a straight line on the border between squares and lasts for 1 minute. The barrier is created with the Hardness and Hit Points equal to those of the testudo shield and is immune to critical hits and precision damage.</p>"

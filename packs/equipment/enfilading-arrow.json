When you fire an activated <em>enfilading arrow</em>, it sails upward and shatters into countless copies. The arrows then rain down in a @Template[burst|distance:10] at any point within your weapon's first range increment, dealing @Damage[6d8[piercing]|options:area-damage] damage to all creatures in the area (@Check[reflex|dc:25|basic|traits:ammunition|showDC:all|options:area-effect]).</p>\n<p>If a creature critically fails the save and you have access to the bow critical specialization effect, the target is @UUID[Compendium.pf2e.conditionitems.Item.Immobilized] and must spend an Interact action to attempt a @Check[athletics|dc:10|name:Pull Free of Pinning Arrow|traits:ammunition|showDC:all] check to pull the missile free; it can't move from its space until it succeeds.</p>"

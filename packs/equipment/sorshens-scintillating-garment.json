Woven of the finest silks and accented with precious stones, the garment is light and easy to move in. Sorshen created, then expanded on the artifact throughout her time as the runelord of lust, adding to it during much of the Age of Legend.</p>\n<p>This ever-shifting garment of silk and gems subtly reshapes itself in response to its wearer, adopting an appearance most flattering to their form. It's a set of <em>+3 greater resilient explorer's clothing</em>. The garment's four pockets each function as separate <em>@UUID[Compendium.pf2e.equipment-srd.Item.Spacious Pouch (Type IV)]{Spacious Pouches (Type IV)}</em>. While wearing the garment, you're immune to mental effects unless you choose otherwise. When you invest <em>Sorshen's Scintillating Garment</em>, you increase your Charisma modifier by 1, or increase it to +4, whichever would give you a higher value.</p>\n<p><strong>Activate—Scintillating Colors</strong> <span class=\"action-glyph\">2</span> (arcane, aura, visual)</p>\n<p><strong>Frequency</strong> once per hour</p><hr /><p><strong>Effect</strong> <em>Sorshen's Scintillating Garment</em> casts @UUID[Compendium.pf2e.spells-srd.Item.Dizzying Colors] (DC 41), heightened to 10th rank, to your specifications.

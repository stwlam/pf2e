When you hit a target with this ammunition, roll a @Check[flat|dc:11]. On a success, treat all the damage dice for your attack as though they rolled the average damage +1, rounded up (for example, a <em>fate shot</em> arrow fired from a shortbow would normally deal 1d6, which has an average of 3.5, so you deal 5 damage). This doesn't affect additional damage dice that only happen on a critical hit, such as those added by the deadly trait. On a failure, roll the damage, but your target takes half damage, and you take the remaining amount as mental damage.</p>"

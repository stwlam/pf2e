Your mount Strides three times. If your mount has a fly Speed, it can substitute a Fly action for any of these Stride actions. As it moves, your dragon companion's magical breath billows around you. The aura from War Rider Stance increases to a @Template[type:emanation|distance:10] during this movement, and each creature that's in the emanation at any point during your movement takes the damage from it (with the normal save). A creature can take damage only once, even if you move past it multiple times.</p>"

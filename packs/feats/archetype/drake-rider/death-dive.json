You command your mount to Fly twice. It must end this movement at a lower altitude than it began its turn at. You and your mount gain a +4 circumstance bonus to AC against reactions triggered by this movement. At the end of this movement, your mount attempts a melee Strike against one creature in its reach. If the Strike hits, the target is knocked @UUID[Compendium.pf2e.conditionitems.Item.Prone] if it's smaller than your mount; if it's a critical hit, the target is knocked prone if it's the same size as your mount or smaller.</p>"

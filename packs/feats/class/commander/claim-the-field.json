The calculated confidence of this brash maneuver unnerves your enemies; any enemy who attempts to damage or remove your banner while it is planted in this way must succeed at a @Check[will|against:commander|options:inflicts:fleeing|traits:incapacitation,mental] save against your class DC or the attempt fails. On a critical failure, the enemy is @UUID[Compendium.pf2e.conditionitems.Item.Fleeing] for 1 round. This is an incapacitation and mental effect.</p>"

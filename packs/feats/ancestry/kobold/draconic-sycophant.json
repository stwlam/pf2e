You gain a +2 circumstance bonus to Perception checks and saving throws against dragons. In addition, whenever you meet a creature with the dragon trait in a social situation, you can attempt a Diplomacy check to [[/act make-an-impression]] on that creature immediately, rather than after conversing for 1 minute; you take a –5 circumstance penalty to this check. If you fail, you can choose to engage in 1 minute of conversation and then attempt a new check rather than accept the failure or critical failure result.</p>"

Whether you were born in these lands or drawn there, those storied legacies have resonated with you on a supernatural level. It seems like each time you learn of some new legend or tale of this land passed down through the generations, there's something in it that directly applies to your life. You've taken to relying upon these legends—be they ancient or modern—as guideposts for your own life's course, knowing full well that they're calling to you and that you're destined to be the focus of one yourself. When you attempt a Performance check or a check to Gather Information, you can spend a Mythic Point to attempt the check at mythic proficiency. The first time each day that you critically succeed at a check to Gather Information, you regain a Mythic Point.</p><hr /><p><strong>Edicts</strong> do what you can to protect the people of the Saga Lands, preserve legends and myths in writing or other forms of art for future generations to enjoy and learn from</p>\n<p><strong>Anathema</strong> allow those in the Saga Lands who need aid to suffer if there's something you can do to help them, regard your own saga as more important than anyone else's, since your tale has yet to be fully told—and not even you know its ending</p>"

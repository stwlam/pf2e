If the pungent cloud was triggered by open flame, chemicals in the air ignite into a flash of fire, dealing @Damage[6d6[fire],6d6[poison]|options:area-damage] damage to all creatures in the area (@Check[reflex|dc:45|basic|options:area-effect] save), after which the pungent cloud disperses.

If just a single PC is in the room, they will be targeted by all four.</p><ul><li><strong>1: Crushing Notes</strong> <span class=\"action-glyph\">1</span> (olfactory, poison) The malfunctioning machinery exudes a blast of concentrated and overwhelming perfume notes into area <strong>B11</strong>. Creatures in the area must attempt a @Check[fortitude|dc:15|traits:olfactory,poison] save or become @UUID[Compendium.pf2e.conditionitems.Item.Stunned]{Stunned 1} (@UUID[Compendium.pf2e.conditionitems.Item.Stunned]{Stunned 2} on a critical failure).</li><li><strong>2: Nozzle Spray</strong> <span class=\"action-glyph\">1</span> (poison) Nozzles built into the machinery extend out to spray toxic, overwhelmingly cloying perfume in multiple directions. One randomly determined target in area <strong>B11</strong> takes @Damage[14d6[poison]] damage (@Check[fortitude|dc:45|basic|traits:poison] save).</li><li><strong>3: Sillage</strong> <span class=\"action-glyph\">1</span> (emotion, mental) A larger, more intimidating nozzle than the one utilized in the previous action extends forward and violently sprays a staggering array of different scents at a random target in the room. The overwhelming mixture of lingering scent (the perfume's sillage) causes the creature to take @Damage[10d6[mental]] damage (@Check[will|dc:45|basic|traits:emotion,mental] save); on a failed save, the creature is also @UUID[Compendium.pf2e.conditionitems.Item.Slowed]{Slowed 1} for 1 round by the overwhelming scents.</li><li><strong>4: Oil Spill</strong> <span class=\"action-glyph\">1</span> (fire) Sparks from grinding machinery ignite a patch of spilled oil somewhere in the room—a random creature in area <strong>B11</strong> takes @Damage[10d6[fire],4d6[persistent,fire]] damage (@Check[fortitude|dc:45|basic|traits:fire] save).</li><li><strong>5: Boiling Beaker</strong> <span class=\"action-glyph\">1</span> (emotion, mental) A pressurized beaker containing boiling fluids springs a leak, and a dislodged tube sprays disorienting, psychotropic fumes at a random creature in the room, who must then succeed at a @Check[will|dc:44|traits:emotion,mental] save to avoid becoming @UUID[Compendium.pf2e.conditionitems.Item.Confused] for 1 round (1 minute on a critical failure).</li></ul>"

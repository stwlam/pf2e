As the halberd passed from the hands of one runelord of envy to the next, the halberd's self-loathing and hatred of the arcane spellcasters they were forced to serve grew. Their own limited arcane magic paled in comparison to their powerful wielders, after all, and the halberd seethed at this perceived inequality. They only grudgingly abide their wielders—runelord or otherwise—and are only truly happy when they're used to cut down those who can cast arcane spells. The halberd can use 3 actions per turn, acting on their wielder's turn, and has a reaction.

The spell or slot lost is randomly determined from the highest rank available, starting at 6th rank and working down.

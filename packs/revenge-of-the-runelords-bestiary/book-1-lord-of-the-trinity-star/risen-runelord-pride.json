These elements generate appropriate sounds and smells, and they feel right to the touch. Elements of an illusory scene are incapable of speech. Unlike with the @UUID[Compendium.pf2e.spells-srd.Item.Illusory Creature] spell, creatures in your scene lack combat abilities and statistics. Your scene doesn't include changes to the environment around it, though you can place your scene within the illusory environment of a @UUID[Compendium.pf2e.spells-srd.Item.Mirage] spell.</p>\n<p>When you create the scene, you can choose to have it be static or follow a program. Though a static scene is stationary, it includes basic natural movement. For example, wind blowing on an illusory piece of paper would rustle it. A program can be up to 1 minute long and repeats when finished. For instance, you could create a scene of two orcs fighting each other, and the fight would go the same way for each repetition. If you create a loop, the two fighters end up in the same place at the start of the scene and at the end of it, but you can smooth the program so it's hard to tell when the loop ends and begins. Anyone observing the scene for more than a few minutes almost always notices it looping. You're unable to alter the program after you create the illusion.</p>\n<p>Any creature that touches any part of the image or uses the @UUID[Compendium.pf2e.actionspf2e.Item.Seek] action to examine it can attempt to disbelieve your illusion. If they interact with a portion of the illusion, they disbelieve only that portion. They disbelieve the entire scene only on a critical success.</p>\n<hr />\n<p><strong>Heightened (6th)</strong> Creatures or objects in your scene can speak. You must speak the specific lines for each actor when creating your program. The spell disguises your voice for each actor.</p>\n<p><strong>Heightened (8th)</strong> As the 6th-rank version, and the duration is unlimited.</p>"

If you and the image are ever farther than 500 feet apart, the spell ends.</p>\n<p>The image can't speak, but you can use your actions to speak through the creature, with the spell disguising your voice as appropriate. You might need to attempt a Deception or Performance check to mimic the creature, as determined by the GM. This is especially likely if you're trying to imitate a specific person and engage with someone that person knows.</p>\n<p>In combat, the illusion can use 2 actions per turn, which it uses when you Sustain the spell. It uses your spell attack modifier for attack rolls and your spell DC for its AC. Its saving throw modifiers are equal to your spell DC – 10. It is substantial enough that it can flank other creatures. If the image is hit by an attack or fails a save, the spell ends.</p>\n<p>The illusion can cause damage by making the target believe the illusion's attacks are real, but it cannot otherwise directly affect the physical world. If the illusory creature hits with a Strike, the target takes @Damage[3d4[mental]] damage. The illusion's Strikes are nonlethal. If the damage doesn't correspond to the image of the monster—for example, if an illusory Large dragon deals only 5 damage—the GM might allow the target to attempt an immediate Perception check to disbelieve the spell. Any relevant resistances and weaknesses apply if the target thinks they do, as judged by the GM. For example, if the illusion wields a warhammer and attacks a creature resistant to bludgeoning damage, the creature would take less mental damage. However, illusory damage does not deactivate regeneration or trigger other effects that require a certain damage type. The GM should track illusory damage dealt by the illusion.</p>\n<p>Any creature that touches the image or uses the @UUID[Compendium.pf2e.actionspf2e.Item.Seek] action to examine it can attempt to disbelieve your illusion. When a creature disbelieves the illusion, it recovers from half the damage it had taken from it (if any) and doesn't take any further damage from it.</p>\n<hr />\n<p><strong>Heightened (+1)</strong> The damage of the image's Strikes increases by 1d4, and the maximum size of creature you can create increases by one (to a maximum of Gargantuan).</p>"

Once created, a risen runelord has no capacity to become more powerful, as they are manifestations of their legacy at a specific point in time (although given enough time and resources, a risen runelord could potentially find a way to overcome this limitation on self-improvement).</p>\n<p>A risen runelord has a modicum of free will, but as long as the one who created them via raise runelord lives, they're bound to their creator's desires. A risen runelord ordered to undertake obviously self-destructive actions might, at the GM's discretion, resist the command and could potentially even break free of their creator's control.</p>\n<p>Since raise runelord draws upon a runelord's legacy as it exists within the Dreamlands, no risen runelord can ever sleep or dream. Xanderghul can use a risen runelord in a special way: he can use any risen runelord (including ones he didn't create) as a spare body. If he's slain, his soul can instantly jump to the closest risen runelord to replace them and continue the fight, unless the PCs can disable this defense during the second adventure in Revenge of the Runelords. Regardless of level, all risen runelords are mythic creatures and are immune to sleep effects.</p><h2>Lust and Pride</h2><p>Of the seven sins, lust and pride are unique among the runelords for these sins were only ever represented by a single runelord—and both still live during the events of this Adventure Path. This may change once the events of Revenge of the Runelords come to a conclusion, in which case the sinful foci for lust and pride become potential options for risen runelords of Sorshen or Xanderghul, but during Revenge of the Runelords, no risen runelords of lust or pride can exist.</p><h2>Risen Runelord Gear</h2><p>A risen runelord's polearm is an extension of their being and cannot exist without them, vanishing upon their death. This doesn't prevent a risen runelord from claiming, carrying, or using other items, and most higher-level risen runelords keep real magic items that remain behind after their death.</p>",

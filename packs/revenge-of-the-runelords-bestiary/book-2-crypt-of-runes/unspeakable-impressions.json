While this movement doesn't put the creature in any direct peril, when they end the movement, they're overwhelmed with the knowledge that had they gone further, something horrible would have happened; the creature becomes @UUID[Compendium.pf2e.conditionitems.Item.Stupefied]{Stupefied 1} for 1 hour by the close call.</p>\n<p><strong>Failure</strong> As success, but the creature becomes @UUID[Compendium.pf2e.conditionitems.Item.Doomed]{Doomed 1} and also stupefied 1 for 24 hours.</p>\n<p><strong>Critical Failure</strong> As failure, but @UUID[Compendium.pf2e.conditionitems.Item.Doomed]{Doomed 2} and @UUID[Compendium.pf2e.conditionitems.Item.Stupefied]{Stupefied 2}. In addition, at the end of the three Strides, the creature vanishes from view, instantly teleporting to some dangerous area or hidden prison. This might be a nearby location that the creature's allies can discover and rescue them from, or it may be somewhere further away that will require more effort to reach before the victim can be rescued.</p>"

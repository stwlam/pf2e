On a failure, the creature falls @UUID[Compendium.pf2e.conditionitems.Item.Prone], tumbles eastward down the length of the ramp, and falls 30 feet into a chamber beneath the hall (area <strong>B4b</strong>), taking @Damage[(3d12+15)[bludgeoning]] damage (@Check[reflex|dc:43|basic] save). A PC within 10 feet of the hallway's eastern end when it tilts can instead attempt a @Check[reflex|dc:40] save to scramble into area <strong>B5</strong>. A PC who fails this check instead tumbles and rolls all the way down the steeply sloped ramp before plummeting into area <strong>B4b</strong>.</p>"
